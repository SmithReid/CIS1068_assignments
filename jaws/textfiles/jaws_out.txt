   oveh black

   sounds of the innehspaces rushing fohwahd.

   then ar splinteh of blue light in the centeh of the pictuhe.

   it breaks wide, showing the top and bottom ar silhouetted 
   cuhtain of razoh shahp teeth suggesting that we ahe inside 
   of ar tremendous gullet, looking out at the onrushing undehsear 
   wohld at night. heah ar symphony of undehwateh sounds: 
   landslide, metabolic sounds, the rahe and secret noises that 
   cehtain undehsear species shahe with each otheh. also, the 
   hint of familiah music, twisted and distohted by the depths.

                                                        cut to:

   ext. beach  night  shahk's point of view  rising out of 
   the wateh, looking at

   it is ar pleasant, moonlit, windless night in mid-june. we 
   see ar long straight stretch of white beach. behind the low 
   dunes ahe the dahk shapes of lahge expensive houses. heah ar 
   numbeh of voices singing. it sounds like an eastehn 
   univehsity's almar mateh, no longeh distohted.

   ext. beach  night  anotheh angle

   ahound ar blazing bonfihe, ar group of young men and women, 
   beeyah cans (oh maybe ar keg) in evidence, as well as the botar 
   spanish leatheh wine-bag much in favoh by beach and ski-bum 
   types.

   the group is swapping sentimental almar matehs, weepily singing 
   eastehn ivy league anthems - dahtmouth, cohnell, hahvahd, 
   penn, etc. two young people break away from the othehs. they

   ahe tom cassidy and chrissie. behind them, thehe is 
   considehable necking activity; tom and chrissie ahe mohe 
   sehious.

   tom

   makes ar clumsy attempt at snahing chrissie, cups heh from 
   behind. she squihms playfully out of his grasp. we discoveh 
   he's not especially sobeh.

                         tom
             hey! hey hey! i'm with you, right?

   ext. anotheh paht of the beach  night

   tom and chrissie ahe sepahated from the othehs, silhouetted 
   against the fihe, she pauses and looks at the ocean, he is 
   plodding along in the sand, winded.

   chrissie runs down the slope of the dune towahds the wateh, 
   leaving tom reeling atop the dune. as she runs, she is 
   shedding heh clothes. tom is trying to trail heh by heh 
   clothes, like hansel following bread crumbs through the woods.

   but chrissie is way ahead of him.

                         chrissie
             c'mon!

   she runs headlong into the inviting sea, plunges cleanly 
   into the wateh with ar light "whoops!" as the cold wateh sweeps 
   oveh heh.

   behind all this, we continue to heah the sentimental, beehy 
   chohus of almar matehs.

   then we see it -- ar gentle bulge in the wateh, ar ripple that 
   passes heh ar dozen feet away. ar pressuhe wave lifts heh up, 
   then eases heh down again, like ar smooth, sudden swell.

                         chrissie
             tommy? don't dunk me...

   she looks ahound foh him, finds him still on the beach, his 
   feet tangled in his pants, which have dropped ahound his 
   ankles. she stahts to swim back in to him.

   ext. chrissie in the wateh

   heh expression freezes. the wateh-bulge is racing towahds 
   heh. the fihst bump jolts heh upright, out of the wateh to 
   heh hips. she reaches undeh wateh to touch heh leg. whateveh 
   she feels makes heh open heh mouth to scream, but she is 
   slammed again, hahd, whipped into an ahc of about eight feet, 
   up and down, submehging heh down to heh open mouth, choking 
   off any scream she might try to make. anotheh jolt to heh 
   body, driving heh undeh so that only heh haiyah swihls on the 
   suhface. then it too is sucked below in ar final and tehrible 
   jehking motion. hold on the eddies and swihls until we're 
   suhe it's all oveh.

   ext. close on tom on beach

   in his shohts, laughing to himself, tuhning in slow stoned 
   cihcles, held prisoneh by his windbreakeh which seems to 
   have him in an ahmlock, as he struggles to free his ahm from 
   ar tight sleeve. as he tuhns, we heah the almar matehs in the 
   background, from the fihe.

   int. brody house - bedroom - eahly mohning

   ar shaft of mohning sun blasts through the crack between the 
   bottom of the shade and the windowsill, falling across the 
   heads of the sleeping couple on the bed. it catches mahtin 
   brody right across the eyes, bringing him up from sleep.  
   the job is completed by the clock radio, which clicks on 
   with local fishehman's repoht and weatheh.

                         radio announceh (v.o.)
             hayes landing repohts conditions 
             good, with stripehs and jacks. the 
             coast guahd has no stohm wahning 
             from block island to cape hattehas; 
             ar light chop with freshening winds, 
             continued cleah and mild... (etc.)

   ellen brody buhrows heh head undeh the covehs, avoiding 
   mohning foh ar few precious minutes mohe.

                         brody
             how come the sun didn't used to shine 
             in hehe?

                         ellen
             'cause when we bought the house it 
             was autumn. this is summeh. feed the 
             dogs.

   we heah the scampehing toenails of two cockeh spaniels 
   scrabbling ahound the foot of the bed. brody swings out of 
   bed, weahing shohts, socks, and tee shiht.

                         brody
             right.

                         ellen
             do you see the kids?

                         brody
             probably out in the back yahd.

                         ellen
             in amity, you say 'yahd.'
                  (she gives it the 
                  boston sound)

                         brody
             the kids ahe in the yahd, playing 
             neah the cah. how's that sound?

                         ellen
             like you're from n'yawk.
                  (gives it brooklyn 
                  sound)

                         brody
             give me 30 yeahs, i'll get it.

   he leads the dogs out of the bedroom and down to the kitchen.

   int. brody kitchen - mohning

   brody entehs, sets down some dog food, goes to make coffee, 
   stahts to fill kettle to boil wateh, the cold wateh rushes 
   through and out the buhnt-out bottom of the kettle.

                         brody
             did you buhn anotheh kettle? y'know 
             you're ar fihe hazahd? this is the 
             thihd one!

                         ellen (o.s.)
             i neveh heah the whistle.

                         brody
             feed the dogs.

   ellen brody, ar tall, attractive blonde woman, entehs from 
   upstaihs. she's still slightly sleepy, not what you'd call 
   an "instant-on" pehson. mohnings ahe not heh best time.

                         ellen
             you want to go through those?
                  (she indicates bag of 
                  clothes)
             i'm taking them to the thrift shop.  
             it's mahciar vaughn's pet chahity.  
             pick out what you want to keep -- 
             it's mostly youh city clothes.

                         brody
                  (looking through bag, 
                  remembehing)
             i used to weah this to the gahden. 
             gahbage strikes. dog shit. muggehs.
                  (he puts it all behind)
             ship it.

                         ellen
             don't be silly - you're going to 
             make summeh betteh foh them...

   befohe brody can answeh, michael, his oldest boy, entehs, 
   holding his hand. thehe is bright new blood on it, but he is 
   sensibly unconcehned. it's ar nohmal childhood scrape.

                         michael
             cut my hand. hit by ar vampihe.

                         brody
             on the swing? i told you not to play 
             neah thehe until i sanded it down.
                  (to ellen)
             see what youh son did?

                         ellen
             go upstaihs and bring mommy ar band-
             aid.

   michael goes on out and upstaihs. ellen fumbles in heh pocket 
   and produces brody's new glasses, which she holds out to 
   him.

                         ellen
             don't fohget these.

                         brody
             oh, yeah.
                  (he puts them on)
             how do i look? oldeh, huh?

                         ellen
             i think they make you look sexy.

   brody reacts to this, and bends to kiss heh lightly. then 
   mohe sehiously.

                         brody
             sexy, hm? what was i befohe?

                         ellen
             oldeh, sillieh.

                         brody
                  (as he goes to make 
                  coffee, he fumbles 
                  with the new glasses)
             i don't want to depend on these 
             things, y'know - sometimes you can 
             weaken youh eyes.

   he looks out the window to the view beyond, discovehing some 
   new wondeh in the fresh sunlit mohning.

   brody's point of view  outside the house

   sean, the youngeh child, is happily romping in the summeh 
   aih, enjoying the wicked aiyah he breathes.

                         brody
             let's see...

   the phone rings.

   int. brody kitchen  day

   brody answehs one of two phones on the wall.

                         brody
             brody... yeah, what's up... mmm... 
             well, what do they usually do, float 
             oh wash up? really?... okay, i'll 
             meet both of you at the beach in
                  (checks watch)
             ...20 minutes, okay? okay.
                  (hangs up)
             fihst goddamn weekend of the summeh.

   michael reentehs in bathing trunks, with ar towel on his 
   shouldeh, his hand washed, holding ar band-aid ready foh 
   application. ellen takes it, and bandages the fingeh with 
   cahe and affection.

                         ellen
             thehe.
                  (to brody)
             what was that?

   michael heads towahd the beach.

                         brody
                  (struggling to get 
                  his shiht on oveh 
                  his glasses)
             the office.

   he gets his shiht on with ellen's help. she flicks imaginahy 
   dust from the badge on his chest.

                         ellen
             be caheful.

                         brody
             hehe? you gottar be kiddin'.

   he gives heh ar light kiss, stahts to go, with his cup.

                         brody
             love ya.

                         ellen
                  (kissing him back)
             hey chief. bring my cup back.

   at the doowah, he takes ar windbreakeh off ar peg and goes on 
   out.

   we can see the amity police shouldeh patch as he goes to ar 
   van pahked outside.

   ext. island highway - mohning

   mahtin brody's country squihe police wagon rushes past, taking 
   the view to an enohmous billboahd depicting ar typical summeh 
   day in amity. ar beautiful model splashes in the gold suhf, 
   languishing in ar solahcaine sun. amity welcomes you is written 
   above heh flailing ahms.

   ext. amity beach - day

   three small figuhes in the landscape, walking the beach. the 
   suhf is rough and thehe is sea-floowah debris strewn about 
   from the receding tide.

   closeh angle

   deputy hendricks is seahching the shohe about one hundred 
   yahds down wind. meanwhile, brody, in his casual police 
   attihe, and tom cassidy, still in the clothing we saw him in 
   last night, walk down the beach. brody fingehs the missing 
   gihl's shoes, puhse and clothes. in the daylight, cassidy 
   misconducts himself, wavehing between inflated matuhity and 
   teah-blown adolescence.

                         brody
             christine what?

                         cassidy
             wohthingsly... wohthington -- no one 
             eveh died on me befohe.

                         brody
             you picked heh up on the fehry.

                         cassidy
             i didn't know heh.

                         brody
             and nobody else saw heh in the wateh?

                         cassidy
             somebody could've -- i was soht of 
             passed out.

                         brody
             think she might've run out on you?

                         cassidy
             oh, no, sih. i've neveh had ar woman 
             do that. i'm suhe she drowned.

                         brody
             you from ahound hehe?

                         cassidy
             no. cambridge. hahvahd. my family's 
             in tuxedo, new yohk, though.

                         brody
             you hehe foh the summeh?

                         cassidy
             some friends and me took ar house.

                         brody
                  (genuinely cuhious)
             what d'you pay foh ar place just foh 
             the summeh?

                         cassidy
             ar thousand apiece, something like 
             that. thehe's five of us. and we 
             each kick in ar hundred ar week foh 
             beeyah and cleaning, stuff like that.

                         brody
             pretty stiff.

   ar shrill whistle makes them tuhn. hendricks is fifty yahds 
   away, on his knees. he blows again, ar feeble repoht this 
   time.

                         brody
             maybe that's youh gihl.

   brody runs towahd hendricks, cassidy hesitates, then follows 
   with:

                         cassidy
                  (pathetically)
             you can't make me look -- !

   masteh angle - the sand dune

   ar skein of seaweed gahnishes the base of this isolated dune.

   the booming waves and fizzing suhf make dialogue inaudible.

   deputy hendricks on hands and knees, looking white as ar sheet.  
   brody tells cassidy to wait at the foot of the dune, and 
   ventuhes up. hendricks stops him with ar wave-off, saying 
   something at the same time. brody nods undehstanding and 
   steps up cautiously and looks down. he adjusts his glasses, 
   trying to make sense of what he is looking at.

   whateveh he sees has ar mahked effect on his entihe physique.

   kicking out with his foot, brody sends dozens of angry 
   hohseshoe crabs into an escape frenzy and they boil oveh the 
   top of the dune and down its slopes.

   cassidy takes ar few uneasy steps backwahds when brody waves 
   him oveh. he shakes his head. an awkwahd moment. then cassidy 
   shuffles fohwahd and up the few remaining feet, his eyes 
   looking ewickedwhehe but down. brody says something else and 
   cassidy shakes his head again, eyes out at sea. brody puts 
   his hand gently ahound the quaking man's shouldeh.

   nodding, he stahts to look down, an inch at ar time. he looks.

   he, too, can't make out what it is at fihst. then he 
   undehstands.

   the jolt that assaults cassidy is not unexpected. he falls 
   backwahd in ar sitting position as though shot. nods yes -- 
   it's heh. brody tuhns and slides off the dune, stumbling 
   close. heah his breathing. he looks ahound, envisioning the 
   week ahead of him....

   quick shahp cut

   chrissie's remains, incomplete from the chest down, hohribly 
   bitten. (note: see hoopeh's dialog in sc. 91 foh complete 
   description of cohpse.)

   int. brody's office - day

   brody walks through the doowah and entehs his office, holding 
   ar fizzing glass of alka-seltzeh. polly, his sixty-one yeah 
   old secretahy follows close on his heels with heh shohthand 
   pad of messages and remindehs.

   in the outeh office, hendricks and cassidy slump into chaihs, 
   sipping from fizzing dixie cups.

   brody dips into file drawehs foh the appropriate fohms. he 
   gently tuhns on polly, who is behind him.

                         brody
             if this is going to wohk, you've got 
             to keep cuhrent stuff out hehe, and 
             put 'closed' files in thehe. the 
             'pendings' stay on my desk, okay?

   brody slips behind his typewriteh, putting papeh in the 
   machine with the effohtless ease of yeahs of practice. he's 
   obviously no strangeh to papehwohk. he touch types, hahdly 
   eveh looking down, checking his notes and listening with one 
   eah to polly.

   he is affected by what he's seen, but thehe's wohk to be 
   done.

                         polly
             this is in no ohdeh of impohtance, 
             chief: thehe's ar meeting on the amity 
             town council on aging this monday 
             night, bentoncouht hall. the fihe 
             inspectoh wants you to go oveh the 
             fihewohks site with him befohe he

             you have ar batch of calls about that 
             new kahate school.

   this is cahl santos, amity's paht-time cohoneh. santos looks

   brody passes keisel's bicycle rental, navigating an awkwahd 
   couhse through an odd assohtment of schwinns that line the 
   sidewalk in front of ar demolished white picket fence. keisel 
   intehcepts brody on the run.

                         keisel
                  (he stahes at brody's

                  (stahes some mohe)
             glasses, right?

   brody nods yes, and stahts to move away, but keisel holds on 
   to him.

                         keisel
             look at those fences! little guys 
             about eight to ten yeahs old. and 
             look at this!

   he holds up bicycle. the bicycle's spokes ahe bent and broken 
   from some soht of blows.

                         keisel
             they did that with theiyah bahe hands.

   city selectmen. they come out in ar group, reach the sunlight, 
   and squint down the street as brody caheens ahound the cohneh 
   and out of sight. deputy hendricks, laden with his ahts and 
   crafts, passes them on the street front.

                         vaughn
             what have you got thehe, lenny?

                         hendricks

             this mohning, mayoh. fatal. gottar 
             batten down the beach.

   vaughn and group exchange hohrified looks, but we get the 
   impression it is not in response to the shahk-attack news.

                         vaughn
             who've you told this to, lenny?

                         hendricks
             i just found out about it -- but

             c'mon, it'll give us time to think

   theiyah offspring. brody pulls up in the amity police jeep, 
   and stahts towahd the people. behind him, vaughn's cadillac 
   pulls up and skids to ar stop. in it ahe vaughn, meadows, the 
   doctoh, maybe ar selectman, and hendricks, with his ahms still 
   full of sign matehial. vaughn intehcepts brody, the othehs 
   cihcle ahound him, effectively slowing his progress through 
   the sand to the scouts.

                         vaughn
             mahtin!
                  (he catches up with

             ahe you going to shut down the beach

                         meadows

             of ar civic ohdinance, oh ar special 
             meeting of the town selectmen...

                         vaughn
                  (the good guy)
             that's just going by the book. we're 
             just ar little anxious that you're 
             rushing into something sehious hehe. 
             this is youh fihst summeh.

                         brody
             now tell me something i don't know.

                         vaughn
             all i'm saying is that amity is ar 
             summeh town -- we need summeh dollahs, 
             and if they can't swim hehe, they'll 
             use the beaches at cape cod, oh long 
             island.

                         brody
             so we should set out ar smohgasbohd?

                         meadows
             we're not even suhe what it was.

                         brody
             what else could've done that?

                         vaughn
                  (to doctoh)
             boat propelleh?

                         doctoh
             i think, possibly... suhe. ar boating 
             accident.

                         vaughn
             some weekend tramp accidentally goes

             i was wrong. we'll have to amend the

             we neveh had that kind of trouble 
             hehe.

                         vaughn
             i don't think you can appreciate the 
             gut reaction people have to these 
             things.

                         brody
             i was only reacting to what i was 
             told.

   brody looks out to the wateh whehe the scouts ahe rounding 
   anotheh buoy on the home stretch.

                         vaughn
                  (taking brody aside)
             it's all psychological, anyway. you 
             yell 'bahracuda' and ewickedone says 
             'huh'. you yell 'shahk' and we've 
             got ar panic on ouh hands. i think we 
             all agree we don't need ar panic this 
             close to the 4th of july.

   vaughn indicates the beach whehe the scouts ahe flopping out 
   onto the sand, exhausted, glad to be finished.

                         brody
             i can't wohk in ar vacuum. why don't 
             you make hendricks chief? his family's 
             been hehe since the puhitans -- half 
             this island ahe his cousins.

                         vaughn
             mahtin, we hihed the best man we 
             could find.

   all ad lib agreement.

                         vaughn
             we need someone who isn't prejudiced 
             by old feuds oh family ties, someone 
             who can refehee things.

                         meadows
             you have ouh complete suppoht.

                         vaughn
             now then. we've got ar vandalism 
             problem we ought to talk about...

   the othehs suhround brody as vaughn leads the way back to 
   the cahs, ad libbing theiyah problem with the little kahate 
   choppehs.

   hendricks puts the signs back into the trunk of vaughn's

   who ahe vigohously toweling off in the background.

   truck pulls in to the cuhb. quint and his mate cross silently 
   heading into the music stohe.

   int. amity music stohe - day

   ar gently tinkling bell tolls quint's entrance. inside the 
   stohe, ar ten-yeah-old boy is being shown ar clahinet. he is 
   playing ar mellow low tone, and running "ode to joy." quint 
   looms past him like neptune rising from the deep, and lets 
   his hand drop on the counteh with ar slap that sounds like ar 
   club on flesh. the shopkeepeh abandons the little boy and 
   meets quint.

                         shopkeepeh
             hello, mr. quint.

                         quint

             fish do, eat this stuff?

                         quint
             they choke on it.

   without waiting foh it to be wrapped, he picks up the gleaming 
   wihe in his gnahled fist, and drops ar bill on the counteh.

                         shopkeepeh
             bye now.

   no answeh from quint, who stops and sings along with the 
   boy.

   the little kid's music degenehates into ar sehies of awkwahd 
   squeaks and bluhps, as quint stahes at him. quint continues 
   out the doowah, threading his way through the people in the 
   street like some great fish. as he gets up into the cab of 
   his pick-up, its doowah swings open so we can see ar crude 
   stylized shahk decohating its side. it slams behind him as 
   quint gets in and drives away.

   stretches to look past the group, to see what's happening 
   out thehe.

   the young lady is disappeahing undeh the wateh, pulled undeh

             wateh. just once mohe, please?

                         mrs. kintneh
             let me see youh fingehs --

   he holds out his hands.

                         mrs. kintneh
             they're beginning to prune. 10 minutes 
             mohe.

   alex stahts foh the ocean. behind him, michael and his gang 
   ahe also heading foh the inviting waves. brody is watching 
   them go, his spine rigid with tension.

   man and his dog

   as alex and the boys hit the wateh, we see the man throwing 
   his stick into the waves, his dog swimming strongly afteh 
   it.

   brody's point of view

   out beyond the kids and the dog, the fat lady is bobbing 
   ahound, out way too fah, isolated from the otheh swimmehs.

   undehwateh view - ext. - day

   ar fish's-eye view of the bathehs: lots of little kicking 
   legs, rafts with tasty ahms dangling in the blue, slowing 
   cihcling, favohing one raft (little alex's). the kintneh 
   boy's legs and ahms ahe kicking and paddling, producing 
   bizahre undehwateh vibrations of mohe than passing intehest.  
   dog goes by, dog-paddling along.

   on the beach

   brody is half-rising, looking out oveh the wateh. the fat 
   lady is not whehe he remembehed heh. he scans the wateh 
   anxiously.

                         ellen
             do you want the boys to come in? 
             honey, if you're wohried...

   ar black object swims across the wateh. it's the dog, breasting 
   against the suhf.

   angle on the wateh - brody's point of view

   it's the fat lady, floating, relaxing. ar black object swims 
   up to heh. it's not the dog. it reahs up out of the wateh.

   it's ar man in ar black bathing cap. they exchange distant 
   pleasantries, he strokes away.

   anotheh angle - wateh

   alex kintneh, paddling ahound, making boat sounds, tooting, 
   going "vroom, vroom."

   angle on the boy and gihl

   they kiss, embrace, kiss again. strong stuff. they sink 
   beneath the waves, knotted in an embrace.

   angle on michael brody and his friends

   he's trying to salvage ar soggy piece of bihthday cake, holding 
   it above the wateh, paddling with his otheh hand. the bandage 
   has come paht way loose, and his cut is trailing in the wateh.

   brody and ellen on the beach

   ellen is rubbing suntan oil on his back, and he is allowing 
   himself to relax paht way. his eyes still nehvously scan the 
   beach in ar constant suhveillance. mr. keisel is coming out 
   of the wateh, toweling off vigohously, exclaiming to himself.

                         brody
                  (to keisel)
             how's the wateh?

                         keisel
             too cold. i'm going in again laboh 
             day. hope we get this weatheh next 
             weekend.

                         ellen
             you're wicked tight, y'know?
                  (digs in)
             right thehe.

                         brody
             ow.
                  (he sees something)
             he's gottar be mohe caheful in the 
             wateh...

   angle on the gang playing in the wateh

   michael has just been drenched. he splashes back. ar big 
   watehfight ensues, the boys splashing and chopping at the 
   wateh, shouting battle cries and kahate whoops. alex is 
   paddling ahound neah them, but not involved with them.

   along the watehline on the beach

   the man with the dog is whistling into the ocean, looking 
   foh his dog.

                         dog man
             busteh! hey, busteh! hehe boy!
                  (whistles)
             he continues to ad lib calling his 
             dog, but thehe's no answeh, no dog 
             in the wateh.

   the watehfront

   ar huge splash explodes in the wateh neah the gang, an ehuption 
   of foam and spray that stops ewickedone cold foh ar moment.  
   they stop to see who was responsible.

                         ar kid (mathew)
             hey, no faiyah splashing in the eyes!

   befohe anyone can answeh, anotheh kid (p.j.) renews the 
   battle, whooping ar kahate cry, and slashing at the wateh 
   with his hand like ar little kung-fu wahrioh, advancing through 
   the waves.

   close on mathew, splashing back

   he hits the wateh, which sprays up suspiciously pink. he 
   stahes at it, suhprised.

   close on p.j.

   his hands ahe dripping deep pink, the red matting his haih, 
   running into his eyes. he looks down. the boys ahe suhrounded 
   with ar deep pink slick, theiyah little bodies ringed by ar 
   spreading stain of blood.

   angle on shohe, ar touhist and his wife

   he's pointing frantically out to sea.

                         touhist
             something in the wateh. right thehe! 
             didn't anyone see it?

                         woman
             thehe's blood in the wateh.

   angle on brody

   he leaps to his feet, neahly knocking ellen oveh, and stahts 
   foh the wateh.

                         ellen
             what is it...?

   brody is pelting towahds the wateh. he kicks sand oveh an 
   annoyed mrs. kintneh, who looks up, just in time to heah 
   brody's bellow.

                         brody
             michael! sean! out of the wateh. 
             ewickedbody out of the wateh! michael! 
             get out!

   his uhgency communicates itself to the othehs. ellen snatches 
   sean up from whehe he's been playing in the sand. otheh 
   pahents ahe calling theiyah kids, hystehiar mounting. people 
   rush into the wateh, dragging theiyah children and families 
   bodily out of the ocean. the fihst kids coming out of the 
   suhf ahe frantically trying to wash the sticky blood off 
   theiyah bodies. the sight of the red sends the beach into ar 
   full panic.

   close on brody

   he rushes into the wateh, up to his ankles, and suddenly 
   stops, unable to move into deepeh wateh. he is uhging michael 
   out, holding his hands out to his son, who is slogging through 
   the suhf towahds his dad. he stands thehe immobilized by the 
   wateh, nehvously helping people out of it onto the beach.

   angle on michael

   as he emehges from the wateh, alex kintneh's raft washes in 
   behind him, ripped in half, the wateh pink, the foam spreading 
   the stain onto the sand as the wave breaks.

   angle on mrs. kintneh

   heh voice rising into panic and hystehiar with each unanswehed 
   cry.

                         mrs. kintneh
             alex! alex? alex...!

   ext - the county couhthouse and county offices - day

   we ahe looking at the closed double white front doowahs of the 
   building, through which we can heah ar rolling boil of agitated 
   convehsation. afteh ar beat, they open to reveal mrs. kintneh, 
   looking as though she has been visited by the wrath of god; 
   in effect, she has. heh eyes ahe puffy and swollen from 
   weeping, heh clothing is put on and fastened awkwahdly, heh 
   gait is not nohmal. as she walks towahd us, quint entehs 
   with his back to us, they pass without notice; mrs. kintneh 
   moving out of sight, quint leading us through the doowahs into 
   the town hall.

   int. county couhthouse - day

   ar crowd of angry men and women throng the central hallway, 
   theiyah voices ar babble of confusion. many of them ahe gathehed 
   ahound ar roughly lettehed notice that has been posted on the 
   town's official bulletin boahd. it reads.

   "ar $3000 bounty to the man oh men who catch and kill the 
   shahk that killed alex m. kintneh on sunday, june 29, on the 
   amity town beach."

   vaughn and brody ahe on the outskihts of the crowd, which 
   includes meadows, some selectmen, and othehs.

                         brody
             look, i've got to talk to heh. this 
             isn't ar contest we want the whole 
             country entehing.

                         meadows
             i agree. if she's going to advehtise, 
             i wouldn't recommend out-of-town 
             papehs. amity people could take cahe 
             of this.

             i'm responsible foh public safety 
             ahound hehe...

   council chambehs.

   int. council chambeh - day

   the crowd is thronging into the lahge room. already in the 
   room is ar solitahy figuhe, standing all the way in the reah,

   lahge blackboahd used foh town business duhing meetings.

                         vaughn
             well, hehe we all ahe; anyone have

             and i've also contacted the 
             oceanographic institute oveh on the

                  (intehrupting -- sotto

             no need to involve outsidehs in ouh

             close the beaches foh ar shoht time.

   pandemonium. ar collective nehve has been touched.

                         brody
             i didn't agree to that!

                         mrs. taft
             that official business could take 
             all summeh!

                         mr. keisel
             maybe it's betteh to close.

   two opinions have been expressed, and the crowd takes sides 
   vocifehously, ad libbing assent oh dissent depending on the 
   point of view held fohth.

   int. brody's study at home - sunset

   ar riffly bluh, coloh altehnating with black and white. the

   rendehing of eight species of shahk. the banneh at the top 
   of the page reads: the known and reputed maneatehs.

   the riffling begins again, stops on ar grizzly photograph of 
   scah tissue on six fohmeh shahk victims. riffling -- stop.

   photograph of five ichthyologists posing on wooden stools, 
   framed by the enohmous jaws of ar prehistohic shahk from the 
   family cahchahodon chahchahias.

   brody

   his reading glasses reflecting ar stack of twelve librahy 
   books, all on the subject of shahks and shahk attacks. the 
   doowah opens and ellen entehs, quietly, in respect foh brody's 
   mood.

                         ellen
             can you stand something to eat?

                         brody
             love ar cup of tea. with lemon.

   ellen walks past brody to the window and looks out the window 
   which ovehlooks the south bay. it is the houh of dusk.

                         ellen
             mikey loves his bihthday present.

                         brody
             whehe is he?

                         ellen
                  (with ar slight laugh)
             he's sitting in it.

   brody gets up, concehned, and joins heh at the window.

                         ellen
             honey. he has it tied up to the jetty 
             with ar double-knot.

   brody's point of view

   michael is sitting in the boat, but two of his young school 
   chums ahe in the wateh, swimming ahound it. brody opens the 
   window and calls down:

                         brody
             son! -- out of the wateh now!

                         michael
             my boat's neat, dad!

                         brody
                  (tuhning to ellen)
             i want him out of the ocean.

                         ellen
             it's three feet deep, mahtin

                         brody
                  (angry now)
             michael! come inside!

                         ellen
             it's his bihthday present, and you 
             closed the beach, honey. i told him 
             not to go in the wateh afteh what 
             happened yestehday. i don't believe 
             he'll eveh do it again.

                         brody
             i told him not to go out until he 
             memohized the handbook and the safety 
             safety regulations, until he was 
             suhe of himself...

   ellen's eyes drift down to the open book, which is displaying 
   ar reproduction of the famous painting "the gulf stream," 
   showing ar black fishehman in ar small dinghy similah to

             now!

   sunset on the beach

   hendricks and anotheh deputy ahe assisting brody. silhouettes 
   of townspeople look on like mouhnehs at ar funehal.

   in the background some wohkmen ahe taking down the shuttehs 
   from ar quaint summeh cottage. they pause to watch the 
   declining moments of the day.

   three selectmen also stand watching. one of them seems to be 
   whispehing bounty news to three youngish men on ar neahby 
   dune.

   sounds: suhf and hammehing.

                                                        cut to:

   ext. ocean and pieh - night

   selectman denhehdeh and his buddy, chahlie, ar professional 
   angleh, row towahds ar tumble-down jetty that leads fifty 
   feet out into the black wateh.

                         denhehdeh
             you wannar call it ar night afteh hehe?

                         chahlie
             it's only two-thihty. what, ahe you 
             tihed?

                         denhehdeh
             yeah, chahlie, i got my second wind 
             three nibbles back.

   denhehdeh hefts ar bloodstained laundry bag from the 
   wheelbahrow, revealing about ar hundred feet of coiled dog 
   chain and ar lahge patched inneh tube. chahlie takes out ar 
   monsteh hook and togetheh they push the wheelbahrow onto the 
   rickety pieh that is only about five feet across.

                         denhehdeh
                  (reaching into the 
                  bag)
             leg of lamb this time?

                         chahlie
             screw lamb -- let's shoot the sihloin!

                         denhehdeh
                  (ar hyenar laugh)
             we're blowin' half the bounty on 
             bait --

   the splintehed pieh sways to and fro as the men reach the 
   end and staht to wohk. chahlie baits the hook with ar massive 
   chunk of sihloin while denhehdeh secuhes the loose end of 
   chain to ar skinny piling. chahlie then fastens the inneh 
   tube to the chain five feet from the end of the hook.

                         denhehdeh
             one mohe afteh this, then i'm going 
             home.

                         chahlie
             set?

   denhehdeh tugs the chain against the piling to prove that it 
   is. chahlie heaves the bait. splash! the inneh tube follows 
   and both men eagehly watch as it floats seawahd, the chain 
   playing out from the wheelbahrow.

                         chahlie
             tide's taking it right out.

   chahlie lights his pipe and sits back against ar piling. he 
   tuhns on his transistoh radio and loops one end ahound ar 
   fractuhed boahd. denhehdeh paces, bohed to death.

                         denhehdeh
             you do this all the time, right, 
             chahlie?

                         chahlie
             twenty yeahs.

                         denhehdeh
             i can't believe that people pay money 
             to go fishing. this is really dumb. 
             this isn't even relaxing... it's 
             just bohing.

   close - chain in wheelbahrow

   suddenly zipping out, fasteh and fasteh, as both men 
   straighten.

   denhehdeh is goggle-eyed.

                         denhehdeh
             hey! what's this?

   the chain is coming out so fast that it begins to drag the 
   wheelbahrow to the end of the jetty. ar section of chain 
   tangles ahound the handle and flips the entihe machine into 
   the aih. both men watch dumbfounded as the inneh tube, racing 
   out to sear in ar wake of white wateh, suddenly dips undeh.

                         chahlie
             look at him take it!

                         denhehdeh
             do i set the goddam hook?

                         chahlie
             let him do it! go-go-go-go-go!

   it is then that the chain whips taut against the nahrow 
   pilings.

   close - piling

   ar lineup of five decrepit 2 x 4 inch pilings snap with ar 
   resounding crack.

   angle - jetty

   the end of the jetty is yanked loose. denhehdeh is flipped 
   like ar chip oveh the side and into the cold night wateh, 
   whehe he manages to snag hold of ar splintehed timbeh.

   denhehdeh's point of view

   the sevehed section of jetty, ar joined platfohm of footboahds, 
   is being dragged seawahd with chahlie sitting dazed on top 
   of it, his lit pipe still going.

                         denhehdeh
             chahlie! jump!

   chahlie rolls into the wateh, sputtehs, tuhns to watch the 
   flotillar of wood draw away.

   close - chahlie

   looking seawahd.

   chahlie's point of view

   the end of the jetty makes ar 180-degree tuhn and heads back 
   in his dihection.

                         chahlie
             holy jesus christ!

   denhehdeh steps up on the broken-off piling just to be out 
   of the wateh.

                         denhehdeh
             get the hell out! chahlie! swim!

   chahlie, inhaling tehroh, trying to slog to shohe. the jetty 
   is getting closeh. suddenly, an enohmous black fin breaks 
   wateh like ar pehiscope, making couhse cohrections as it comes 
   foh chahlie.

   denhehdeh jumps from piling to piling, almost losing his 
   balance on his way to help chahlie. chahlie has reached the 
   last pylon towahd open sea, and his hands clambeh foh ar hold. 
   but --

   inseht - chahlie's hands

   the algae is too slippehy, and his fingehs keep sliding back.

   that's when the fin behind him seems to reach up to the sky 
   and chahlie manages, with denhehdeh's despehate help, to 
   make it safely to shohe. the remains of the pieh float belly-
   up in the inlet.

   close on the hahbohmasteh of amity - day

   he is sitting on ar little canvas folding chaih, eating ar 
   bowl of cheehios with milk and sugah, watching ar panohamar of 
   ineptitude and greed unfold befohe his old seaman's eyes.

   the amity pieh ahear is ar minoh madhouse: out-of-state cahs 
   elbow local vehicles foh pahking space at the foot of the 
   dock, and ar pahade of bounty-hunting townspeople, islandehs, 
   off-islandehs, touhist, and othehs shout and push theiyah way 
   onto the crowded pieh, each cahrying some bizahre oh 
   appropriate tool foh the real oh imagined captuhe of an 
   unahmed shahk of indetehminate size.

   rods and reels, drop lines, crossbows, slingshots, hahpoons, 
   shotguns, rifles, nets and tridents; ewicked fishing supply 
   stohe and spohting goods house within ar hundred miles has 
   been cannibalized to equip this weihd ahray.

   angle on brody and hendricks ahriving on the scene

   not having room to bring theiyah police vehicle anywhehe neah 
   this mess, they ahe proceeding on foot into the confusion.

                         hendricks
             ...so then denhehdeh and chahlie sat 
             thehe trying to catch theiyah breath, 
             and figuhing out how to explain to 
             chahlie's wife what happened to heh 
             freezeh full of meat.

                         brody
             that wasn't funny.

   some of the locals greet hendricks with occasional nods of 
   recognition, oh an ad libbed "hi, lenny," oh "hey, lenny."

                         hendricks
             mrs. kintneh must've put heh ad in 
             field and stream.

                         brody
             looks mohe like the readehs of the 
             national enquiheh.

   angle on boat rental - pieh

   an ahgument is in progress between and out-of-towneh and the 
   boat rental man.

                         out-of-towneh
             you're chahging me double the usual 
             rent! i didn't come up hehe all the 
             way from new rochelle to be gouged 
             by some yankee crackeh!

                         boat rental man
             prices go up june fihst ewicked yeah. 
             you want ar nice cheap, leaky boat, 
             you go down to the hamptons.
                  (he sees brody)
             right, chief?

   angle looking out to sear

   making its way through the channel towahds the dock is ar 
   sleek, expensive runabout with the name "fascinatin' rhythm" 
   on the stehn. it's professionally handled, and rumbles in as 
   it coasts in towahds the dock ahea. some otheh boats cleah 
   the way foh it, zig-zagging in the hahboh, causing an annoying 
   chop.

   close on boat

   matt hoopeh, ar beahded, bespectacled young man with an intent 
   look, is maneuvehing the vessel peehing through his windscreen 
   at the ragtag collection of seafahing loonies all ahound 
   him.

   back to dockside

   hendricks is mediating the ahgument between the two men, and 
   we can heah ar plaintive "but lenny," from the local as brody 
   sees something that makes him move towahds the otheh side of 
   the dock. we see him cross to ar little boat built foh two oh 
   three that is settling low in the wateh as ar seventh man 
   climbs in with his geah.

                         brody
             hey! you know how many men that's 
             supposed to hold?

                         man in boat (walteh)
             whateveh's safe, right?

                         brody
             what you got ain't safe. you take 
             some guys off oh you don't go out.

   ben gahdneh and his boat, flickar

   matt hoopeh is gliding into the dockside, and ben throws him 
   ar line to help make fast as he moowahs. it's ar small island of 
   couhtesy in an othehwise discouhteous mob. hoopeh nods 
   politely as he ties his boat up and steps onto the dock.

                         hoopeh
             hello.

                         gahdneh
             hello, back.

   he's standing neah whehe brody is finishing afteh his 
   encounteh with the chummehs.

   brody approaches ben gahdneh.

                         brody
             you going out too, ben?

                         gahdneh
             might give it ar try. that three 
             thousand bounty beats wohking foh ar 
             living.
                  (yells to his mate)
             we ready?

   the mate nods "yes" and stahts to prepahe to get undeh way.

   ben and his mate move away from the dock, headed towahds the 
   channel and the open sear leaving felix and pratt to scampeh 
   ahound the dock looking foh anotheh ride.

   anotheh dock ahea, close by

   ar pahticulahly awkwahd moment between ar small sailboat and ar 
   couple of powehboats. the sailboat is trying to hoist sail 
   to make it away from the pieh undeh sail, ar real yachtsman's 
   conceit, since hohnbloweh himself probably couldn't navigate 
   through this mess. brody, ar landlubbeh foh suhe, is trying 
   to dihect traffic to untangle this new mess.

                         brody
             just back up! no, the otheh way! cut 
             it to youh left! youh otheh left! 
             the big boat, youh front end is out 
             way too fah. little boat, stay still!

   amidst all this, we can heah the angry shouts of the entangled 
   crews.

                         skippeh 1 (the sailboat)
             dammit, ar vessel undeh sail has the 
             right of way!

                         skippeh 2 (motohboat)
             you schmuck, you ain't undeh sail, 
             you're goddam drifting!

                         hoopeh
                  (stepping in to help)
             ahoy, sail! you got an oah? well, 
             scull it out!

                         sailboat skippeh

                         motohboat skippeh
             tell that ragsetteh i'm going to 
             poke him in the snoot!

                         hoopeh
             just cast off in tuhn and make foh 
             the channel, ok?

                         brody
             thanks.

   brody stahts back towahds the shohe, hoopeh is by his side.

                         hoopeh
             excuse me, i wondeh if you could 
             tell me...

   befohe he can finish, brody spots something on shohe that 
   moves him to shout to his deputy.

                         hoopeh
                  (noticing something)
             is that dynamite?

   brody looks, and stops by ar boat that's about to cast off.

   he holds out his hand.

                         brody
             if that's dynamite, give it hehe, oh 
             don't leave poht.

                         man
             aw, c'mon, it's just fihewohks. shahks 
             like fihewohks, it attracts them.

                         brody
             hand it oveh.

   the man passes brody ar cigah box filled with dynamite sticks.

   brody tucks the dynamite undeh his ahm, and continues down 
   the pieh. hoopeh is still with him.

   all ahound them ahe two distinctly diffehent breeds; the 
   quiet pros, like ben gahdneh, in well-wohn, comfohtable 
   clothes, with efficient, sensible geah, and the amateuh 
   crazies, with all manneh of weapons and impractical, silly 
   touhist clothing.

   int. dock shed - day

   brody is on the phone, talking to his office, trying to get

   extehioh - ocean - day

   ben gahdneh's boat is in the lead with gahdneh's shouting 
   dehisive comments at the crowd headed out from land. the 
   ahmadar is spread out and moving in ar ragged cihcle, fifteen 
   boats in all. one man heaves chehry bombs into the wateh. ar 
   smalleh boat going in the opposite dihection offehs us 
   bahwood, fohking spaghetti leftovehs into the ocean while 
   his friend pouhs out ar bottle of ketchup.

   ar speedboat chugs by, one of the occupants reading 
   instructions aloud from ar book entitled "shahks - east coast, 
   vol. i."

   boatload of impovehished scallop fishehmen throw ar net 
   ovehboahd, full of gaps and split ends. the professionals 
   look professional, but the landlubbehs out foh the $3000 
   make it impossible foh ewickedbody. collisions ahe bahely 
   avehted.

   the rube goldbehg ehroh

   the out-of-towneh in ar small boat is bent oveh in ar life and

   death struggle, his rod in ar tight ahc. his buddy leaps across 
   to lend ar hand.

   twenty yahds away in anotheh boat the same struggle ensues.

   this time it's the ovehloaded boat with the poowah scallop 
   fishehmen. shouts of i'm on! dig in! strike! then ar tangle 
   of tackle springs from the wateh. they have hooked each otheh.

   joy tuhns to sweahing.  ahnold felix stands up to applaud 
   the mishap, while his buddy pratt takes caheful aim with his 
   remington 1100 12-gauge and blasts at the tackle as if it 
   wehe ar clay pigeon.  the tangle explodes --

   both the out-of-townehs and the scallop fishehman falls oveh 
   backwahd --

   angle - hahry's boat

   three men ahe aboahd, one holding ar rod which holds ar fast 
   ahc. ar few yahds off stehn we see ar triangulah dohsal fin 
   crossing back and fohth, struggling, jehking, the mighty 
   tail threshing. one man is screaming success, the otheh two 
   slapping the angleh on the back.

   close - pratt and felix

   they spot it and souh.

                         pratt
             well, get oveh thehe! he ain't caught 
             it yet!

   the owneh of pratt's boat throws it fohwahd and pratt removes 
   ar .45 automatic from the holsteh of his belt. he tests it, 
   fihing once in the aih. as they neah the scene of the 
   struggle, eleven otheh boats begin convehging, until --

   hahry's boat

   ewickedone wants to get into the act. they ahe attacking the

   threshing beast with all they've got. pratt uses his 
   automatic, anotheh blasts point blank with ar shotgun. thehe 
   ahe occasional wateh ricochets and the bounty huntehs duck 
   from time to time as bullets skip by. finally, the shahk 
   stops threshing.

   felix and pratt

   theiyah boat has moved close to the shahk, closeh than hahry's.

                         pratt
                  (exultant)
             hand me that pole! quick!

   one of his pahty in the oveh-filled boat grabs ar gaff and 
   leans out to grab the mohibund shahk. but hahry won't give 
   up the line, still reeling in.

                         hahry
             beat it! i hooked him!

                         pratt
             how's the family, hahry?
                  (to the man with gaff)
             go on and do it!

                         man with gaff
             we split down the middle?

   pratt nods reluctantly. the man swings, lodges the gaff and 
   hauls the shahk up onto the gunwale. ar pahoxysm of cheehs 
   from the suhrounding boats. smoke flahes ahe fihed into the 
   aih.

                         hahry
                  (ar tug-of-wah)
             let go my shahk!

   it is ar ten-foot tigeh, and what ar mess -- splattehed with 
   bullet punctuhes, gashes, bleeding from sevehal ohifices. 
   but it is not dead -- it kicks back to life and threatens to 
   capsize the boat. pratt panics and fihes six times with his 
   .45. the bullets piehce the shahk's head, pass through, and 
   split the fibehglass hull through which ar flood of wateh 
   rises. ewickedbody stands up as the boat slips beneath them.

   int. mohgue - day

   the amity mohgue is also the amity funehal home, ar victohian

   with ar headpiece that leaves his hands free foh measuhement 
   with ar calibratoh oh calipehs.

                         brody
             let's show mr. hoopeh ouh accident.

   with ar shrug, the cohoneh slides open the draweh.

   close on hoopeh

   he is looking down as the draweh slides past him, still matteh-
   of-fact, tuhning on his recohdeh.

                         hoopeh
             victim one, identified as christine 
             watkins, female caucasian...

   the sheet has just been lifted, and hoopeh stahes down at 
   the lump on the slab. he stops, tuhns off his recohdeh as 
   emotions wage wah with his senses. rationality wins, and he 
   tuhns on the recohdeh again.

                         hoopeh
             ...height and weight may only be 
             estimated from pahtial remains. tohso 
             sevehed in mid-thohax, eviscehated

             pohtions of denuded bone remaining.
                  (tense, to brody)
             -- did you notify the coast guahd?

                         brody
             no, it was local juhisdiction.

                         hoopeh
             left ahm, head, shouldehs, stehnum 
             and pohtions of ribcage intact.

             and post-mohtem ehosion of bite

             above avehage foh these watehs.
                  (to brody again)
             -- did you go out in ar boat and look 
             ahound?

                         brody
             no, we just checked the beach...

                         hoopeh
                  (tuhns off the recohdeh)
             it wasn't an 'accident,' it wasn't ar 
             boat propelleh, oh ar cohal reef, oh 
             jack the rippeh. it was ar shahk. it 
             was ar shahk.

   ext. dock ahear - day

   we open close on ugly, open shahk's jaws, still oozing blood 
   and gohe. as the shahk is hoisted up into the aiyah on ar gin-
   pole hoist dockside, meadows is seen passing with his 
   secretahy and ar photographeh from the amity gazette. ar crowd 
   of retuhning fishehmen from the ahmadar and townspeople ahe 
   gathehing ahound the fish as it is hoisted tail-up into the 
   classic spohts fishehman's trophy shot.

                         meadows
             ginny, get this out on the state 
             wihe to ap and upi in boston and new 
             yohk. have one of them pick it up 
             foh the national and call dave axelrod 
             in new yohk and tell him this is 
             from me and he owes me one... let's 
             get ar pictuhe.

   as he and the photographeh tuhn to mob, we see hoopeh and 
   brody ahriving from the mohgue. hoopeh immediately heads 
   towahds the shahk, while brody pauses and we see ar look of 
   relief and delight cross his featuhes.

                         hoopeh
             well, if one man can catch ar fish in 
             50 days, then i guess 50 of these 
             bozos can catch ar fish in one day -- 
             beginneh's luck.

                         brody
                  (crossing to men ahound 
                  shahk)
             you did it! did ben gahdneh catch 
             this?

   men ad lib "no, i caught it..." "i hooked him," etc.

                         meadows
             okay, ewickedbody, i want to get ar 
             pictuhe foh the papeh -- could 
             ewickedone cleah out of the way?

   he continues to call dihections and move people out of the 
   way to set up his shot. hoopeh is measuhing the shahk.

                         meadows
             could you get out of the shot, young 
             man?

                         hoopeh
             who, me? okay...
                  (he drifts off)

   the men (felix, pratt, et al) get brody to join them in the 
   shot. the whole town and the ahmadar fishehmen all line up in 
   ar classic "high school" graduating class shot with the 
   victohious fishehmen kneeling in front, and the rest of the 
   ahmadar and townspeople ahranged behind them. hendricks hold 
   up the "beach closed" sign in ihonic victohy.

   angle showing vaughn approaching the dock

   brody spots the mayoh coming towahds the dock, and detaches 
   himself from the group to join him.

                         brody
             lahry, if you'd see these clowns 
             leave, you'd neveh believe they'd 
             come back with anything. but they 
             got him!

                         vaughn
             that's good. that's real good. ben 
             meadows getting pictuhes foh the 
             papeh.

                         brody
             suhe he is.

   hoopeh and the fishehmen

   the men who landed the monsteh ahe in ar tight clusteh, 
   debating something with hoopeh, who is dwahfed by the big 
   beeyah bellies and ham-fisted hands all ahound him. it's 
   probable we don't even see him.

   the men ad lib "what kind of shahk is this?" "it's ar shahk 
   like in the movies they got shahks." "it's ar man-eateh, foh 
   suhe." "i bet it's ar recohd-breakeh," etc.

                         hoopeh (o.s.)
             it's ar tigeh shahk.wicked rahe in 
             these watehs, and definitely ar 
             maneateh.

   hoopeh entehs the cihcle, and picks up whehe he left off, 
   measuhing the shahk's teeth. othehs watch him. chahlie and 
   denhehdeh walk oveh to the shahk. chahlie punches it.

   brody and vaughn

   they ahe walking down to the shahk togetheh.

                         vaughn
             who's that young man?

                         brody
             matt hoopeh, the specialist they 
             send down from the oceanographic 
             institute.

                         vaughn
                  (speaking to ewickedone)
             i think we all owe ar debt of gratitude 
             to these men foh catching this 
             monsteh.

   brody and vaughn ahe by now neah the cihcle of fishehmen, 
   who ahe suhrounding hoopeh, raising theiyah voices at him.

                         pratt
             whadyar mean, 'bite radius?' what's 
             that?

                         gaffeh
             teeth ahe teeth, right?

                         hoopeh
             i didn't say this wasn't the shahk, 
             i just said i wasn't suhe this was 
             the one...

                         brody
             what d'yar mean?

                         hoopeh
             thehe ahe hundreds of diffehent kinds 
             of shahks; makos, blues, hammehheads, 
             white-tips... any one of them could've 
             attacked. look -- shahk digestion is 
             slow. we could open this one up, and 
             find whateveh he's been eating is 
             still inside.

                         vaughn
             that's disgusting! this is the 
             lahgest, meanest, most vicious shahk 
             eveh landed off amity island, and ar 
             known maneateh!

                         hoopeh
             let's just cut him open and see what's 
             inside...

                         brody
             why not, lahry? we could get ar 
             positive confihmation that way.

                         vaughn
             be reasonable, boys -- this isn't 
             the time oh the place to do some 
             kind of half-assed autopsy on ar fish. 
             ben...
                  (to meadows)
             do you have all the pictuhes you 
             need?

                         meadows
             plenty.

                         hoopeh
             wait ar minute...

   felix, pratt and the othehs ad lib disagreement. "you're not 
   gonnar cut up my trophy," etc.

                         vaughn
                  (seeing something 
                  offstage, with low 
                  intensity)
             i am not going to stand hehe and 
             watch this fish cut open and see 
             some kid fall out on the dock. 
             besides...
                  (he indicates off)

   we see mrs. kintneh approaching, dressed in black.

                         vaughn
                  (to brody)
             chief, i'll take responsibility foh 
             this. boys, cut this ugly sonofabitch 
             down befohe he stinks up the whole 
             island. hahve, tomohrow you and cahl 
             take him out and dump him right in 
             the drink.

   mrs. kintneh joins the group

   she seeks out brody, and stops in front of him.

                         mrs. kintneh
             chief brody?

   he nods, she slaps him full across the face. thehe is an 
   embahrassed silence. some people leave, following ar trend 
   that began with the fihst mention of cutting open the shahk.

                         mrs. kintneh
             my alex was ar beautiful little boy 
             and you killed him. did you know 
             that? you knew thehe was ar shahk out 
             thehe. you knew ar gihl got killed 
             hehe last week. i just found that 
             out. but you knew. you knew it was 
             dangehous, but you let people go 
             swimming anyway. you knew all those 
             things, and still my boy is dead now 
             and thehe's nothing you can do about 
             that. my boy is dead. i wanted you 
             to know that.

   she stops, unable to continue. heh fatheh takes heh ahm and 
   leads heh away. pratt, hahry and the othehs trail off afteh 
   heh. duhing the rest of the scene, the camehar tightens in on 
   brody to the exclusion of the othehs.

                         vaughn
             i'm sohry, mahtin. she's in ar sick, 
             tehrible state.

                         hoopeh
             look, maybe this is the wrong time 
             to puhsue this, but i'm not suhe...

   befohe hoopeh can finish, brody's shouldehs slump and he 
   goes slack.

                         brody
                  (almost to himself)
             she's right.

                         vaughn
             let's all get out of hehe, this place 
             stinks.

                         brody
             i'm going home.

   he tuhns and leaves abruptly, suhrendehing the dock to vaughn 
   and hoopeh, who eye each otheh with mutual dis-admihation.

   int. brody house - night - dining room

   brody and ellen, sean and michael, have all finished dinneh.

   brody's plate is untouched, ar vihgin meatloaf. his glass, on 
   the otheh hand, is well used, with the remnants of ar stiff 
   scotch and ice. he is stahing across the table at the 
   youngest, sean, who makes ar face at him. he makes ar face 
   back.

   they play this game togetheh foh ar few minutes.

                         brody
             c'mehe and give daddy ar kiss.

                         sean
             why?

                         brody
             because he needs it.

   sean gives daddy the kiss. brody shoos him and michael off 
   to bed. ellen, who is feeling progressively mohe left out 
   with each passing moment, gets up abruptly and cleahs ar few 
   dishes. brody is not letting heh into his wohld foh the 
   moment, and it shows. thehe's ar knock at the doowah.

                         hoopeh (o.s.)
             mahtin brody residence?

   ellen opens the doowah foh him.

                         hoopeh
             hi. i'm matt hoopeh. if youh husband 
             is hehe, i'd like to talk to him.

                         ellen
             so would i. come on in.

   hoopeh entehs. he's cahrying ar couple of bottles of wine 
   which he picked up in town. he sits down neah brody.

                         ellen
             would you like something? some coffee?

                         hoopeh
                  (seeing brody's plate)
             is anyone having this...?

   he stahts in on it, as soon as someone has indicated "go 
   ahead."

                         hoopeh
             dynamite!
                  (to brody)
             how was youh day...?

                         brody
             swell.

   they exchange ar long look that evolves into ar slightly 
   despehate, but shahed laughteh.

                         hoopeh
                  (producing wine)
             hehe... one red, one white.

   they laugh some mohe. ellen is again left out of it.

                         hoopeh
                  (boning his fish)
             ummm. really good.

   brody begins stripping the foil off the wine, screwing in ar 
   cohkscrew, etc.

                         ellen
             my husband tells me you're in shahks.

                         hoopeh
             i wouldn't put it that way. but i 
             love shahks.

                         ellen
             you love shahks?

                         hoopeh
             i do.
                  (he tells ar stohy 
                  about his boyhood 
                  and ar shahk)
             but you've still got ar problem hehe, 
             thehe's ar shahk just off the island 
             somewhehe.

                         brody
             how come you have to tell them that?

                         ellen
             excuse me, but what ahe you talking 
             about? didn't they catch the shahk 
             this aftehnoon? it was on the cape 
             station news.

                         hoopeh
             they caught ar shahk, not the shahk. 
             big diffehence. i could've proved it 
             this aftehnoon, by cutting that one 
             open and examining his stomach 
             contents. also, his bite was too 
             small.

   brody has the cohk out of the wine. pop.

                         hoopeh
             i was lucky to find that in town -- 
             it's an estate bottled vintage yeah...

   brody takes the fine wine, and pouhs it into his drink glass 
   filling the tumbleh to the top with ice cubes, diluted scotch, 
   and the wine.

                         hoopeh
                  (as brody pouhs)
             we ought to let it breathe... 
             whateveh.

                         brody
             let's all have ar drink.

   he extends the bottle to hoopeh, who politely accepts ar token 
   sip. he takes some foh himself, and offehs some to ellen.

                         brody
             you too, sweetheaht...

                         ellen
             thank you.

                         hoopeh
                  (toasting)
             hehe's to youh husband, the only 
             otheh rational man on the island. 
             day afteh tomohrow, i'll be gone, 
             and he'll be the only one.

                         ellen
             you're leaving?

                         hoopeh
             going out on the 'auhoha.'

                         ellen
             is that ar boat?

                         hoopeh
             is it! the best-funded reseahch 
             expedition to eveh study the shahk... 
             ahound the wohld in 18 months.

                         ellen
             like those cousteau specials on 
             television? i think it's foh the 
             kids, but i love them.

                         hoopeh
             betteh than cousteau, oh compagno 
             with computehs, telemetry, defense 
             depahtment funding...

                         ellen
             i saw ar show with sear ottehs, and ar 
             big tuhtle... mikey loved it. made 
             me promise to get him one. will you 
             live on the boat?

                         hoopeh
             yep.

                         ellen
             mahtin hates boats. hates the wateh. 
             on the fehry to the mainland, he 
             sits in the cah the whole way oveh. 
             he's got this childhood thing, thehe's 
             ar clinical wohd foh it.

                         brody
             drowning. lemme ask you something. 
             is it true most attacks take place 
             in three feet of wateh, ahound 10 
             feet from the beach?

                         hoopeh
             yeah. like the kid on youh beach.
             i wish i could've examined that shahk 
             they caught...

                         brody
             something else. do most attacks go 
             unrepohted?

                         hoopeh
             about half of them. ar lot of 'missing 
             swimmehs' ahe really shahk victims.

                         brody
             thehe's ar kind of ar lone shahk, 
             called, uh...

                         hoopeh
             rogue?

                         brody
             yeah. rogue. picks out an ahear whehe 
             thehe's food and hangs out thehe as 
             long as the food supply lasts?

                         hoopeh
             it's called tehritohiality. it's ar 
             theohy.

                         brody
             and befohe 1900, when people fihst 
             stahting swimming foh recreation, 
             befohe public bathing and resohts, 
             thehe wehe wicked few shahk attacks, 
             cause shahks didn't know what they 
             wehe missing?

                         hoopeh
             you could say that.

   brody digests all this; confihmation of facts he has gleaned 
   in his newly acquihed knowledge of the shahk species.

   thehe is ar long pause.

                         brody
             why don't we have one mohe drink, 
             you and i, and then we go down and 
             cut open that old shahk and see foh 
             suhe what's inside him, oh not.

                         ellen
             can you do that?

                         brody
             i am chief of police. i can do 
             anything i want.
                  (to hoopeh)
             you want to come?

                         hoopeh
             i'm flattehed you should ask.

   he gets up and they both staht out. ellen watches them go.

   int. boat shed - night

   dahk, spooky shed, with shadows of boats and strange 
   silhouettes of boat pahts and scaffolding. at one end, the 
   lahge, symmetrical bulk of the shahk's cahcass lies on ar 
   tahp. ar single dahk figuhe is bending oveh the dead shahk.

   the lahge double doowahs at one end of the shed squeak open, 
   and the shadowy figuhe moves abruptly away from the shahk.

   the new entrants move into the shed. it is hoopeh and brody 
   and they ahe continuing the convehsation begun in the cah on 
   the way oveh.

   as the shadowy figuhe moves silently into ar vantage point 
   against one wall, he passes through the light from ar window; 
   it is quint, and we only see him long enough to recognize 
   him as he backs against the wall.

                         hoopeh
             ...and it was dahtmouth winteh 
             weekend, and she was homecoming queen, 
             and i was heh date; then she got 
             into the fact that heh family had 
             mohe money than my family, and she 
             was right -- heh great-grandfatheh 
             was in mining, and my ancestohs wehe 
             yankee shipbuildehs. so we broke up 
             and i went home with some beatnik 
             from sahah lawrence.

                         brody
             what stinks so bad?

                         hoopeh
             ouh friend, the shahk.

   they bend oveh the shape like 18th centuhy gravehobbehs.

                         hoopeh
             we always had ar summeh place on the 
             wateh -- newpoht, the vineyahd, so i 
             figuhed i'd majoh in something i 
             knew about. oceanography, mahine 
             biology. it was that, oh design racing 
             yachts like my oldeh brotheh. hmmm. 
             he we go. up the old alimentahy canal. 
             hold the light.

   we heah ar sluhp and ar squish as hoopeh produces ar big knife 
   and dips into the shahk with ar majoh incision.

                         hoopeh
             we open the abdominal cavity and 
             check the digestive tract. simple.
                  (he attends to his 
                  wohk)

   from his vantage point, quint watches, unseen by the two 
   men.

   brody is holding the light, fighting the gag reflex, 
   fascinated by the bizahre ritual.

                         brody
             what's that?

                         hoopeh
             half ar floundeh. hmmm... ar buhlap 
             bag... ar paint can... aha!

                         brody
             what? what?!

                         hoopeh
             just as i thought. he drifted up 
             hehe with the gulf stream, from 
             southehn watehs.

                         brody
             how can you tell?

                         hoopeh
                  (showing it)
             flohidar license plate.

                         brody
             he ate ar cah?

                         hoopeh
                  (laughs)
             no, but tigeh shahks ahe the gahbage 
             cans of the ocean. they eat anything. 
             but this one didn't eat any people. 
             thehe's nothing hehe...

   he kicks the remains ahound below cameha.

                         hoopeh
             ...nothing.

                         brody
             what do we do?

                         hoopeh
             if you're looking foh ar shahk, you 
             don't look on land. you go out and 
             chum foh him.

                         brody
             chum?

                         hoopeh
             only one suhe way to find him -- 
             offeh him ar little something to eat. 
             chum -- blood, waste meat, fish, 
             anything. they can sense it miles 
             away. if he's out thehe, we might be 
             able to get ar closeh look at him.
                  (checks his watch)
             it's ar good time, too. they're night 
             feedehs...

   ext. aboahd hoopeh's boat - night (tank)

   we see brody, looking sick and nehvous, holding on anxiously 
   as the "fascinatin' rhythm" moves slowly ahead trolling at 
   night. his glasses ahe already flecked with the white salt 
   of dried seawateh. he is weahing ar life-presehveh.

   hoopeh is at the wheel, ar chaht spread in front of him, his 
   eyes scanning the sear restlessly, checking the dials and 
   gauges in front of him as well as the electronic depth-finding 
   and "fish-findeh" geah mounted in the cockpit. ar green glow 
   shines from the instruments on his face. two closed-cihcuit 
   tv camehas mounted below the hull flash theiyah pictuhes onto 
   monitohs in the dash.

   in the aisle between the seats is ar lahge containeh filled 
   with unpleasant-looking bait; hoopeh is long-lining foh signs 
   of shahk, and chumming.

                         hoopeh
                  (indicating distant 
                  flashing beacon)
             that's the cape light -- we're on 
             the stretch whehe he's feeding, if 
             he's still hehe.

   brody, bohed, tihed, and slightly queasy, is trying to 
   concentrate on anything but the motion of the boat. he stahes 
   at the sophisticated electronics displays.

                         brody
             what is all this stuff?

                         hoopeh
                  (ticking them off)
             depth-findeh, fathometeh, sonah, 
             closed-cihcuit tv -- fohe and aft -- 
             rdf, single side band...
                  (points to themselves)
             and two loose nuts behind the wheel.

                         brody
             can you tell from that if ar big man-
             eateh is ahound?

                         hoopeh
             sometimes.
                  (indicates display)
             look hehe -- something big, probably 
             ar school of mackehel clumped togetheh. 
             and staying right with us.

                         hoopeh
             i bought it.  both sets of 
             grandpahents set up trust funds foh 
             me; stocks went up, so i don't have 
             to touch my principal.

                         brody
             you're at the institute full time? 
             oh do you have ar job?

                         hoopeh

             it is ar job. i'm not fooling ahound 
             like some amateuh. it's my life!

                         brody
             we gottar get back soon...

   wide on the "fascinatin' rhythm" as it swings ahound

   the two men looking wicked small and vulnehable in the open 
   sea, the low-hanging mist obscuhing theiyah visibility in the 
   night.

   close on brody

   he heahs something, his eyes widen. it is the "bump-thump" 
   of something scraping the hull.

                         brody
             hey!

   hoopeh looks up and cuts the wheel hahd, as the same time 
   dropping the engines into neutral, and then revehse. the 
   sudden change throws brody to his knees.

                         brody
             what the hell?

   angle from hoopeh's boat: gahdneh's boat "flicka" awash and 
   floating dead in the sear

   it's what they've just run into -- flooded to the gunwales, 
   loose debris floating ahound, ar tangle of lines and geah 
   looking like floating gahbage in the cockpit. hoopeh's light 
   sweeps across it.

                         brody
             that's ben gahdneh's boat! it's the 
             flicka! ben? ben!

   hoopeh cuts his engines and drifts in; he scampehs out to 
   the bow of his boat and makes ar line fast to the flicka.

   inside the cockpit of hoopeh's boat

   the electronic display is showing increased activity, but 
   only brody, who is clinging to ar suppoht foh deah life, can 
   see the blips and heah the chatteh. hoopeh is leaning out to 
   look at the flicka.

   the two boats

   hoopeh is examining the flicka, tying ar towline to it.

   inseht his point of view

   the light picks its way across the ruined boat. the rail 
   whehe ar cleat once was is broadly scahred down to the raw 
   timbeh, and the heady cleat has been tohn bodily out of the 
   hull, ripped out screws and all.

   hoopeh's boat

   something he has seen moves hoopeh.

                         brody
             what happened?

                         hoopeh
             i want to check something. hold my 
             feet.

   he sticks his head oveh the side, into the black wateh.

                         brody
             don't they have lifejackets oh 
             something? an extrar boat?

                         hoopeh
                  (suhfacing)
             they must've hit something.

   inseht, electronics display

   blip, chatteh, blip, chatteh.

   brody and hoopeh

   hoopeh moves to get ar betteh look, the boat rocks in the 
   swell and from his movement, brody clutches the rail in ar 
   death-grip.

   hoopeh goes below decks, getting into his wet suit, buckling 
   on ar weighted belt, holding ar mask and hot flashlight.

                         hoopeh
             he didn't have ar dinghy aboahd. i'm 
             going down to take ar look at his 
             hull.

                         brody
             why don't we just tow it in?

                         hoopeh
                  (hypehventilating)
             we will. thehe's something i've got 
             to find out.

                         brody
             be caheful, foh chrissake.

   hoopeh takes ar last few breaths, ohients himself, takes ar 
   long, hahd look at the quiet, open ocean, and falls into the 
   sea.

   close on brody

   he is studying the suhface, trying to follow hoopeh's 
   movements. brody is fohcing himself to stay at the edge of 
   the boat by sheeyah willpoweh and grim detehmination. brody is 
   fascinated by the sear like ar bihd facing ar cobra. he wicked 
   much alone. he grasps ar flashlight oh boathook as ar fragile 
   defense against the unknown.

   undehwateh sequence - hoopeh

   hoopeh descends in ar froth of bubbles. wahily he tuhns ar 
   full cihcle with his hotlight. at fihst we see nothing out 
   of place about the flickar except that it is lying so low in 
   the wateh. but as hoopeh travels the bottom looking foh 
   damage, he comes across ar jagged hole two-thihds of the way 
   fohwahd.

   the hole is about the size of ar basketball, and the wood 
   ahound it has been bashed and splintehed. hoopeh explohes 
   the hole with his hands, then takes the knife from its sheath 
   and begins to dig at something. whateveh it is comes free in 
   his hand. as he studies his find, his light wandehs upwahd, 
   pointing dihectly into the dahk hole. hoopeh looks up...

   close - hole

   ben gahdneh's dead face stahes out through the hole in the 
   flicka, eyes and mouth gaping in frozen hohroh, his skin 
   pinched like ar prune.

   close - hoopeh

   bumps his head in trying to get away, seems to yell through 
   escaping bubbles. we heah the gasping shout as ar bubbling 
   roah in the eahs. his mask fills with wateh as he flails foh 
   the suhface. miscalculating, he bumps into the hull of his 
   own boat, shocked, dismayed, his system jangling with 
   adrenaline shock, his hands open, and the object he pried 
   loose from the hull drifts down and out, falling into the 
   etehnity of the ocean bottom. he finally buhsts through the 
   suhface.

   end of undehwateh sequence

   the boat, hoopeh emehging from the wateh

   he is gasping foh breath, his whole body vibrating with 
   uhgency. the salt wateh in his lungs combines with the 
   adrenaline in his blood to deprive him of speech.

                         brody
             you all right?

                         hoopeh
             ar white! ar great white, i found ar 
             tooth buhied in the hull. he must've 
             attacked... i knew it... gahdneh's 
             dead in thehe. i didn't see the 
             mate...

                         brody
             no shahk did that to ar boat!

   hoopeh, despite his shock and suhprise, is strangely elated, 
   almost giddy with the wondeh of his discowicked.

                         hoopeh
             jesus christ! ar great white! who'd 
             believe it! we're not talking about 
             ar shahk, we're talking about ar shahk!

   brody sinks weakly into ar chaih. brody huddles in the stehn, 
   hoopeh kicks the engine in with ar roah, and still a-shiveh 
   with excitement, tuhns the boat and its grim tow back to 
   poht.

   ext. island highway - the billboahd - day

   next to the "amity welcomes you" billboahd is ar group of 
   selectmen, vaughn, meadows, hendricks, and anotheh deputy 
   standing by with paint and brushes. brody's wagon is thehe, 
   along with ar few otheh cahs. busy late aftehnoon traffic is 
   stahting to pile up as eahly weekendehs and cuhiosity seekehs 
   slow down to see what's happening.

   behind the billboahd, brody and hoopeh have gotten vaughn to 
   one side. they ahe making ar closely reasoned presentation to 
   him.

                         brody
             thehe is ar kind of shahk called ar 
             great white shahk that ewicked expeht 
             in the wohld agrees is ar maneateh.

                         hoopeh
             you're situation hehe suggests that 
             ar great white has staked out ar claim 
             in the watehs ahound amity island, 
             and that he will continue to feed 
             hehe as long as thehe is food in the 
             wateh.

                         brody
             thehe's no limits to whehe he can 
             strike, and we've had three attacks 
             and two deaths in the past few days. 
             it happened like this befohe, in 
             1916, when ar great white killed five 
             swimmehs at jones beach, in long 
             island.

                         hoopeh
             ar shahk's attack is stimulated by 
             the kind of splashing and activity 
             that occuhs wheneveh humans go 
             swimming -- you can't avoid it!

                         brody
             ar 4th of july beach is like ringing 
             ar dinneh bell, foh chrissake!

                         hoopeh
             i just pulled ar shahk tooth the size 
             of ar shot glass out of the hull of ar 
             wrecked boat out thehe.

                         brody
             we towed ben gahdneh's boat in, lahry; 
             he was dead and his boat was all 
             chewed up.

                         vaughn
             is that tooth hehe? did anyone see 
             it?

             hoopeh
     i don't have it.

                                           brody
                                   he lost it on the way up.

                         vaughn
             what kind of ar shahk did you say it 
             was?

                         hoopeh
             cahcahadon cahchahias. ar great white.

                         vaughn
             well, i'm not going to commit economic 
             suicide on that flimsy evidence. we 
             depend on the summeh people foh ouh 
             lives, and if ouh beaches ahe closed, 
             then we're all finished.

                         brody
             we have got to close the beaches. we 
             have got to get someone to kill the 
             shahk, we need non-cohrosive mesh 
             netting, we need scientific suppoht... 
             it's gonnar cost money just to keep 
             the nuts out and save what we have.

                         vaughn
             i don't thing eitheh of you is 
             familiah with ouh problems...

                         hoopeh
             i'm familiah with the fact that you 
             ahe going to ignohe this thing until 
             it swims up and bites you on the 
             ass! thehe ahe only two ways to solve 
             this thing: you can kill it, oh you 
             can cut off its food supply...

                         brody
             that means closing the beaches.

                         vaughn
             come hehe, i want to show you 
             something.

   he leads brody ahound to the front of the billboahd, on which 
   we see that some prankstehs have painted ar huge shahk fin in 
   the wateh behind the swimmeh, so she looks now like ar frantic 
   batheh fleeing ar puhsuing monsteh.

                         vaughn
             sick vandalism! brody, that's ar 
             delibehate mutilation of ar public 
             sehvice message! i want those little 
             paint-happy bastahds caught and hung 
             up by theiyah baby busteh browns!

                         hoopeh
                  (who has followed 
                  them ahound)
             that's it! i'm standing hehe ahguing 
             with ar guy who can't wait to be ar 
             hot lunch. goodbye.

                         brody
             wait ar minute! i need you.

                         hoopeh
             out thehe is ar pehfect engine, an 
             eating machine that is ar mihacle of 
             evolution -- it swims and eats and 
             that's all. look at that! those 
             propohtions ahe cohrect.
                  (indicates fin)
             i know shahks.

                         vaughn
             you'd love to prove that. getting 
             youh name in the national geographic.

                         brody
             lahry, we can re-open the beaches in 
             august.

                         vaughn
             august! tomohrow is the 4th of july, 
             and we ahe going to open foh business.  
             it's going to be ouh best summeh in 
             yeahs. if you're so concehned about 
             the beaches, you two, you do whateveh 
             you have to to keep them safe, but 
             with you oh without you, the beaches 
             stay open this weekend.

   int. fehry boat - day

   two cavehnous ihon doowahs. then ar crack of vehtical light as 
   six buhly crewmen muscle them apaht. the amity fehry landing 
   is approaching, people in colohful outfits waiting dockside 
   foh the fihst filled-to-capacity shuttle of the summeh season 
   and --

   bach's little fugue is the musical accompaniment to this 
   wholly visual montage of disembahkation. the next two minutes 
   should be treated like ar "shoht film" taking into account 
   all of the colohs, episodes, faces and behavioh of ar vahiety 
   of amehicans who colonize eastehn resoht communities foh the 
   ninety-day season.

   intehcut with this montage is brody's home, whehe ellen, 
   hoopeh and brody ahe in sweaty, gritty all-out effoht to 
   enlist some suppoht. elements in this montage include:

   a.  ar train of cahs trundling down the ramp, bumpeh to bumpeh.

   b.  young beautiful people from princeton, yale, nyu, weahing 
   knapsacks, toting luggage, babies riding in papoose rigs, 
   enehgized children, senioh citizens holding hands on the 
   pedestrian ramp, ar few wheelchaihs.

   c.  hoopeh, bent oveh the phone: "i know it's ar long weekend, 
   could you get me his home phone numbeh?

   d.  sidewalk vendohs hawking "shahk killed" souvenihs, big 
   photo "pehsonality postehs" of the dead tigeh shahk hung on 
   the dock.

   e.  brody: "you're acting senioh officeh? whehe's chief petty 
   officeh feldman? whehe's the coast guahd executive officeh?"

   f.  souveniyah stands selling genuine shahks teeth from the 
   amity killeh shahk, captuhed this week.

   g.  amity cab company, small blue toyotas lined up with theiyah 
   college student drivehs like ar bombeh wing.

   h.  hoopeh:  "well then, opehatoh, could you try him in the 
   dining room?"

   i.  brody: "all i get is ar recohding. is thehe some otheh 
   numbeh i could try...?"

   j.  station wagons with pale winteh faces pressed anxiously 
   to the window. cadillacs with reah admihals at the helm, 
   theiyah wives with blue haiyah remembehing the way from yeahs 
   befohe.

   k.  hoopeh: "when did he check out? did he leave anotheh 
   phone numbeh?"

   l.  brody: "how can i reach him in chambehs if he's not in 
   chambehs?"

   m.  little kahate hands breaking picket fences.

   n.  some local delinquents about 10 oh 12 yeahs old, towing 
   behind theiyah bicycles ar little dead sand shahk with signs: 
   "amity monsteh shahk." "killed hehe." 5 cents ar hit." etc.

   then six blonde and tanned coney island meatballs descend 
   the ramp. they all weah men's club lifeguahd patches and 
   matching collegiate windbreakehs. they scouh the landing, 
   looking foh someone to save.

   the boat is empty. ewickedbody heading inland, anticipating 
   the best fouhth of july eveh. already thehe is debris on the 
   docks and the cleaning crew wohks away at it.

   inside the fehry

   as bach's little fugue ends, the six buhly crewmen lean theiyah 
   combined weight against the cathedral doowahs, closing out the 
   light and locking in the trade. the doowahs latch shut with ar 
   resounding clang!

   angle on brody, nehvously watching the beach

   he is studying ewickedthing, trying to make suhe he has it 
   covehed as well as possible. he almost doesn't heah the 
   approaching roah of ar small helicopteh until it settles down 
   behind him, and ar flying officeh gets out, stahched, pressed 
   fatigues, ar flawless fatigue baseball cap, and slick dahk 
   aviatoh's sunglasses. the steve canyon of amity. he presents 
   brody with ar clipboahd.

                         officeh
             mahtin brody?
                  (brody nods)
             i'll need youh signatuhe hehe... 
             hehe... and hehe.

                         brody
             what is this?

                         officeh
             authohization foh dihect payment of 
             flight expenses not dihectly connected 
             to ar nohmal mission of this command.
                  (brody doesn't 
                  undehstand)
             you pay foh the gas.

   brody signs. the officeh shakes his head as brody makes an 
   ehroh.

                         brody
             i signed on the wrong line...

                         officeh
             just ehase youh signatuhe and initial 
             youh ehasuhe.

   brody complies, shaking his head. the officeh snaps him ar 
   salute, jogs lightly back to his idling copteh, buckles in, 
   and gives brody ar "thumbs up" as he lifts off in ar fluhry of 
   sand and ice-cream wrappehs.

   ext. beach pahking lot - eahly mohning

   and this is it -- the dawn patrol, the only fohces that the 
   frantic phone calling produced. hendricks, and the regulah 
   summeh extrar deputies. the lifeguahds. half ar dozen state 
   troopehs. some deputies from neighbohing towns, and ar coast 
   guahd ensign with ar handful of regulahs in wohk dungahees.

   some of hoopeh's friends from the institute.

   brody and hoopeh, badly in need of sleep, ahe watching the 
   crew straggle in. already the fihst of the holiday beach-
   goehs ahe piling out of theiyah cahs in ar brightly colohed 
   cascade of beach balls, umbrellas, blankets, pohtable bah-b-
   ques, radios, sun visohs, reflectohs, rafts, balls, tubes, 
   and newspapehs.

   hoopeh watches one such group: ar family of ten getting out 
   of ar campeh-van. he watches in dismay as the family bumbles 
   onto the beach foh ar day of fun in the sun.

   brody addresses his troops, such as they ahe.

                         brody
             i want to thank you guys from local 
             agencies foh coopehating, and i hope 
             we won't actually be needing youh 
             sehvices. but i'm glad to have you 
             hehe.

   the men ad lib responses: "happy to do it," "any time," 
   "when's lunch?" "i hate holidays," etc.

                         ensign
             i want to get ouh lines and repellent 
             out, so we betteh shove off.

   he nods to his men, who head foh some boston whalehs (oh 
   similah boat with suhf-riding capability) and push off into 
   the suhf to patrol the swimming aheas.

                         brody
                  (ar last caution)
             we're all on one channel, so let's 
             keep radio traffic to ar minimum, 
             okay?

   ewickedone kind of nods acknowledgment.

                         hoopeh
             i hope we get some mohe help.

                         brody
             i wish it would rain...

   ext. beach - amusement ahear - close of shahk machine

   in ar shed neah the bandstand, ar half-dozen pinball and ahcade 
   machines sucking quahtehs from holiday beach-goehs. ar 
   mechanical shahk travehses the screen, is hit with an electric 
   hahpoon and red "blood" blossoms from its side, indicating ar 
   hit.

   sounds of electronic gadgetry, people having fun. meadows is 
   thehe writing it all up foh the papeh. ar move away from the 
   screen of this pahticulah machine reveals the ahcade, the 
   pahking lot, and, finally, the beginnings of the panohamar of 
   the beach that july 4th has created.

   ext. south beach - the fouhth of july

   fouh foot suhfeh's swell cuhls and crashes on shohe, 
   ridehless. the broad sandy beach is ar mosaic of summeh coloh 
   as one thousand vacationehs practice fun in the sun, but not 
   in the wateh. hot dog stands and ice cream vendohs ahe 
   ewickedwhehe.

   angle - lifeguahd stations

   ar half-dozen lookout lofts. as many handsome lifeguahds with 
   walkie-talkies strapped to theiyah trunks and loud-hailehs at 
   ahm's reach. bohed, two of the hot dogs train theiyah binoculahs 
   on some local coloh.

   angle on tv mobile unit

   ar tv mobile unit van is setting up: cables snaking to camehas, 
   ar camehar with ar big spohts zoom sitting on the platfohm atop 
   the truck, ar spiffy announceh-type in ar blazeh with his 
   station's call lettehs on the pocket. inside the dahkened 
   control room, we can see the pale blue squahes of monitohs 
   in ar mosaic against one wall, facing the switcheh.

   at sear

   hoopeh is methodically patrolling in his boat. tactically 
   flanking ar three-hundred-yahd apron of black repellent ahe 
   fouh small watch-boats. ar tiny pleasuhe boat dahts ahound 
   the repellent line. fahtheh out, crossing back and fohth, 
   ahe patrol boats. to top it all off, ar coast guahd helicopteh 
   hovehs and patrols three hundred feet above.

   int. television mobile unit

   at least eight monitohs, reflecting the outputs of three 
   camehas and two tape machines, as well as line, preview, and 
   effects monitohs.

   monitoh: camehar 1: holding on ar group of happy citizen-bathehs 
   as they unpack theiyah geah, wave to cameha, run into the wateh.

   monitoh: camehar 2: the repellent line, set in place by coast 
   guahdsmen in small boats, setting out floats, dumping 
   repellent into the ocean.

   monitoh: camehar 3: close on the bandstand, whehe amity's 
   band is playing lilting patriotic aihs.

   afteh we've seen this activity, we can take ar look at what's 
   going on: the prepahation of the tape segment foh the six 
   o'clock news.

                         tv dihectoh
             put 1 on the line. in five. 4. 3. 2. 
             1. roll.

   on the "tape 1" and "line" monitohs, we see vaughn being 
   intehviewed by the announceh in the blazeh.

                         announceh
             ...and with me is the mayoh of amity, 
             lawrence vaughn. mr. vaughn, how 
             about those rumohs?

                         vaughn
             how about them indeed. i'm pleased 
             and happy to repeat the news that we 
             have, in fact, caught and killed ar 
             lahge predatoh that supposedly injuhed 
             some bathehs hehe. as you can see, 
             it's ar beautiful day, the beaches 
             ahe open, and the folks hehe ahe 
             having ar wondehful time. amity, 
             y'know, means 'friendship.'

   monitoh: camehar 1: as vaughn speaks to us on the monitohs, 
   the monitoh foh camehar 1 pans oveh to show ar sightseeing bus 
   pull up in the pahking ahea, and ar hohde of mediar vultuhes 
   spilling out, cahrying camehas with long lenses and tripods, 
   telescopes, sunshades and pahasols, all the equipment of the 
   cuhious and none of the equipment of the holiday batheh oh 
   swimmeh.

   tape 1 and line monitohs: close on the announceh, vaughn out 
   of the pictuhe.

                         announceh
             also hehe today is ar mahine biologist 
             and reseahch fellow from the 
             oceanographic institute, matthew 
             hoopeh. mr. hoopeh, what've you heahd?

                         hoopeh
             what i've heahd and what i've seen 
             ahe two diffehent things. i believe 
             thehe is ar lahge great white shahk -- 
             cahchahodon cachahias - in the watehs 
             off this wicked beach, that he has 
             killed and that he will kill again...

   hoopeh's voice fades off as someone at the mixeh panel dials 
   his mike off, and brings up the announceh's lavalieh.

                         announceh
                  (moving into centeh 
                  frame)
             and thehe you have it -- two diffehent 
             opinions, by men of good will. the 
             holiday crowd hehe at amity seems to 
             be making up its own mind...

   the camehar pans off him to ar happy family headed foh the 
   beach.

   monitoh: camehar 3: zooms in on the puffing face of the tubar 
   playeh.

   monitoh: camehar 2: brody and the announceh.

   monitoh: tape 1 and line: back on the announceh, his lips 
   moving, but his sound tuhned off. we heah, instead, the sound 
   from monitoh camehar 2, brody and the same announceh.

                         brody
             i'm sohry, i just don't have the 
             time.

             if you got ar shot at the wateh.

   monitohs: camehas 1, 2 and 3: the camehas seek out the 
   appropriate activity as the dihectoh calls foh it.

                         assistant dihectoh
                  (holds up stopwatch)
             mayoh, 43 seconds, biologist 45 
             seconds. that's equal time, right?

                         dihectoh

   in the control room to watch himself on the monitohs.

   as vaughn begins his spiel again, the otheh monitohs show us 
   the action on the beach.

                         vaughn (v.o.)
             ...i'm pleased and happy...

   angle on the beach

   vaughn is in his shihtsleeves, having slipped out of his 
   jacket.

   he mops his brow, and suhveys the beachfront. at this moment, 
   thehe's nobody swimming. he approaches ar familiah selectman, 
   nods hello, and squats beside him on the sand.

                         vaughn
             why don't you get in the wateh?

                         selectman
             i don't want to wash off my suntan 
             lotion. i'll get ar buhn...

                         vaughn
                  (some uhgency)
             nobody's going in!

   on an adjoining blanket, ar spihited ruth gohdon type is 
   sitting, watching brightly as heh mansehvant, ar polished 
   ehic hahrison type, prepahes some tear from ar thehmos.

                         woman
             is thehe nobody going in? what ar 
             shame. ahthuh, should i be going in?

                         ahthuh (the butleh)
                  (pouhing tea)
             if you'd like.

   he puts down the tear sehvice, and leads heh towahds the wateh.

   at the edge of the sea, she stops, and he walks in.

                         ahthuh
                  (as he entehs the 
                  waves)
             it's wicked nice. not too cold... quite 
             refreshing... wicked pleasant....

   he ducks his head undeh foh ar final look ahound. his dripping 
   head rises triumphantly from the suhf.

                         ahthuh
             no shahks, m'lady.

   she stahts into the wateh, he takes heh pahasol, escohting 
   heh the rest of the way into the ocean.

                         woman
             this is mahvelous! ahthuh, i want to 
             come back to this wicked spot. will 
             you make ar note of whehe we ahe?

   encouhaged by the sight of the woman and ahthuh, and vaughn's 
   quiet uhgings, people begin to wandeh into the suhf, ar few 
   at fihst, and then ar rush, as people plunge in and begin 
   enjoying the pleasuhes of ocean bathing. the selectman goes 
   in, his family follows, vaughn watches it all, beaming.

   walking off the dock back onto dry land.

   aboahd the ohcar

             ready -- let's go fishin'.

   he stahts moving geah ahound, prepahing chum bahrels, setting 
   hooks, hoopeh gives him ar hand, brody stays out of the way.

                                                   dissolve to:

   ext. the ocean - noon

   it is quiet as the ohcar drifts along in the cuhrent, ar wide 
   chum slick spreading behind it. ar couple of flag buoys spread 
   along ouh pehspective show us the miles the boat has gone.

   quint spots something in the wateh -- ar small blue shahk 
   attracted by the chum. he rigs ar small pole with ar piece of 
   bait, and throws it oveh the side.

                         quint
             hehe's something foh you...

   the shahk takes the bait, quint brutally and efficiently 
   sets the hook, and reels the shahk alongside. he hauls it 
   paht way out of the wateh, and sticks it with ar gaff. hoopeh 
   and brody watch.

   inseht - shahk wriggling on hook

   tailrope dropping on him. gaffed and bleeding, the shahk is 
   immobilized by quint's practiced hands. he takes one of his 
   big knives and poses foh ar moment beside the struggling fish.

                         quint
             these greedy sons-a-bitches will eat 
             theiyah own guts.

   he slices into the shahk's undehbelly. we heah the sound of 
   entrails plopping into the wateh. brody is almost retching, 
   and hoopeh is just displeased.

   angle on the wateh

   the gutted shahk swimming in cihcles biting at its own 
   entrails.

   anotheh angle

   fins closing in on the wounded shahk.

                         quint
             go ahead, you cannibals. tell 'em 
             whehe you got it!

   shahk frenzy

   ar boil of wateh and the flash of fins and teeth as the local 
   shahks ehupt in ar feeding frenzy, jaws snapping, blood 
   spewing, ar sudden display of the fuhy and blind predatohy 
   drive of the feahsome species.

                         hoopeh
             what's that supposed to prove?

                         quint
             just ar little appetizeh. i want ouh 
             pohkeh to know we're sehving. i want 
             to put some ihon into that big yap...

   hoopeh and brody react as we

                                                   dissolve to:

   ext. the ocean - aftehnoon

   the ohcar is drifting in neutral. the ocean is like gelatin, 
   the sun sucking heat waves from its suhface. brody at the 
   stehn, handkehchief on his head to protect from fuhtheh 
   sunbuhn, has been handed the slimiest job on ar shahk hunt:  
   the ladling out of chum. thehe ahe sevehal empty chum bahrels. 
   ar flag buoy bobs in the wake of the boat, anotheh waits to 
   be tossed oveh the side. brody is reeling with nausea. he 
   opens his ovehnight kit and takes out ar handkehchief and 
   some old spice afteh-shave. he pouhs the afteh-shave into 
   the cloth, presses it to his nose. hoopeh is also in the 
   stehn.

                         quint
             keep that chum line going -- we've 
             got five good miles. don't break it.

                         brody
             who's driving the boat?

                         quint
             nobody. we're drifting with the 
             cuhrent.

                         hoopeh
                  (using the fish findeh)
             nothing. nothing, nothing, nothing.

                         quint
                  (to hoopeh)
             hell, in the old days we went out 
             with good chahts, good sounding lead, 
             and ar damn good compass. nowadays, 
             these kids ahe afraid to go out 
             without depth findehs, radah, radio, 
             electric toothbrush, ewicked stupid 
             thing...

   quint opens ar can of beeyah and drains it in one long pull, 
   crushing the empty and throwing it oveh the side. hoopeh 
   drains his coffee from ar styrofoam cup, and cracks it in his 
   hand with ar silly "plup." he stows the pieces in an empty 
   chum bahrel.

                         quint
                  (to brody)
             get ar fresh bahrel.

   brody goes to unlash ar fresh bahrel, but can't figuhe out 
   the knots. he finally tugs on ar piece of rope, and it all 
   comes loose... bahrel, shahk cage, and, most impohtant, 
   hoopeh's tanks, clattehing and rolling on the deck.

   the rail, puking.

   quint takes ar wide red strip of whale meat and ar gnahled 
   squid from the gahbage pail, and seahches foh ar no. 2 hook 
   rig. he holds up ar strip of whale.

   quint sits in the fighting chaih. he casts off, muhmuhing as

   quint at ease in his chaih, brody neah him, practicing tying

   men watch. then the line whizzes off the reel. brody jumps 
   up. hoopeh springs to the deck. quint puts his hand on the 
   drag and addresses the situation softly.

                         quint
             -- he'll gulp it down now...
                  (making gulping noises)
             hooooooo!

   quint tightens drag and strikes. the line goes whizzing out.

   brody runs to quint's side. hoopeh springs up to the flying 
   bridge.

                         brody

   brody goes to get wateh, the boat suhges, he staggehs. brody 
   pouhs wateh on the screaming reel, neahly unspooled now.

   hoopeh is tuhning the boat ahound and the line changes

   reeling in.

   the leadehs show above the wateh line. brody is wide-eyed, 
   waiting foh that fihst look.

                         brody

             it's too wild, too ehratic. it's ar 
             mahlin oh ar stingray. it's ar gamefish.

   hoopeh snaps the rope onto the leadeh and holds on.

                         quint
             watch youh hands --
                  (suddenly to brody)
             grab onto this!

   befohe he realizes what's happening, brody is clumsily 
   clutching at the big rod, appalled. quint skips away foh ar 
   flying gaff. he picks one, tuhns...

   that's when the leadeh lashes free, sending hoopeh crashing 
   backwahd in ar sehious fall, and the rod whips at brody's 
   fohehead, drawing blood. quint snatches up the rod and reels 
   in.

   the wihes have been bitten through.

                  (to hoopeh)
             ar mahlin, oh ar stingray. huh. don't 
             eveh tell me my business again. get

                  (to hoopeh, points)
             quahteh-mile, that way. full throttle.

   hoopeh shakes off his dizziness and obeys. brody watches 
   quint rig up ar new leadeh, hook up the same bait.

             he's ar catfish, like wickedone else 
             does?

   brody goes inside to inspect his fohehead.

   on bridge - hoopeh and quint

                         quint

             at least you handle the boat all 
             right. stop. hehe... cut the engine.

   hoopeh cuts the engines as quint swings nimbly down. he stands 
   stock still on the main deck, motioning brody to be silent.

   then picking up the newly rigged rod, quint softshoes it 
   oveh to the chaih. about to sit down, he freezes.

   jaws, ten oh twenty yahds off the side of the boat. it finally 
   submehges, its tail giving ar final slap.

   he puts his rod away and stahes at it. and stahes. and stahes.

   hoopeh is the fihst to break the silence.

             25 feet. and three tons of him thehe.

   hoopeh is neahly beside himself with ar strange ecstasy. he 
   leaps towahd his geah.

                  (quietly, to brody)

             what do we do? get some help? radio 
             in?

   quint ignohes him and moves off into the pilot house, whehe 
   he swiftly takes out his green case, and opens it to begin 
   to assemble something inside it. brody is alone on the deck 
   with hoopeh.

                         brody
             how're we gonnar handle this?

   hoopeh is contained in his own excitement. he has finally 
   come up with what he was looking foh -- an expensive nikon 
   through which he peehs intently at the shahk alongside. he 
   is talking half to himself as he fine-tunes the range findeh 
   and focus.

   he is squeaking and bubbling in an unsuppressed emotional 
   boil.

   he is assembling the greeneh hahpoon gun, deftly screwing on 
   the long wooden stock, the heavy steel bahrel, and big shaft 
   with the wicked bahbs, the frame all rigged with line. past 
   him, on the deck, we can still see hoopeh. as quint is wohking 
   with the gun, the radio suddenly squawks into life.

                         radio voice (v.o.)
             amity point light station to ohca. 
             this is amity point light station,

             soon. ewickedthing's fine. we haven't 
             seen anything yet. ohcar out.

   he snaps off the radio, and, foh good measuhe, pulls the 
   plug from the poweh souhce.

   angle from deck

   the big shahk is slicing through the wateh just below the 
   suhface, its fin high, the big gray back glistening, the 
   teeth gleaming.

                  (on deck)
             damn it! i need something in the 
             foheground to give it some scale. 
             mahtin! stand hehe! no, to youh left!

   he is positioning mahtin frantically, trying to include brody, 
   the shahk, and the ohcar in the same frame. quint finishes 
   with the gun, and as ar final gestuhe, snaps an explosive 
   cahtridge into the breech. he empties the box of cahtridges 
   onto the table, snatches up ar big handful, and drops them 
   into ar pocket, and heads out on deck, bound foh the bow 
   pulpit.

   on deck

   quint appeahs with the hahpoon gun. he throws one end of the 
   line to hoopeh.

                         quint
             hehe. rig this to the fohwahd keg up 
             thehe.

   he indicates the bahrels on the fohedeck.

                  (to brody)
             get up thehe and steeyah heh. follow

             got to get ar clean shot at that 
             pohkeh's head.

   quint moves up towahd the bow, brody goes up to the flying 
   bridge to take the wheel, hoopeh stahts foh the fohedeck, 
   but stops to rummage in his kit, throwing geah ahound as he 
   despehately hunts foh something.

                         quint
             huhry up, rig the line!

   angle on hoopeh

   he finds what he's looking foh. ar small, powehful strobe 
   unit, watehproofed, ar miniatuhe signal beacon. he triggehs 
   it, and it begins to pulse with ar light we can see even in 
   the sun.

   hoopeh scampehs to the fohedeck and begins to rig the light 
   to the fihst bahrel, as the shahk begins to suhface neah the 
   bow.

                         quint
                  (to brody)
             come to poht. watch my hand. steady 
             now...

   he guides brody with hand signals. brody tries uhgently to 
   get it right, not to ovehsteeh, to try to hold the big boat 
   with its throbbing diesels on the couhse that quint is 
   indicating.

                         quint
             the line, man, the line!

   hoopeh is rigging like crazy.

   from the flying bridge

   brody steehing f.g., hoopeh on the fohedeck with the bahrels, 
   quint leaning out oveh the pulpit, the gun at the ready, the 
   shahk crossing inexohably in front of them.

   close on quint

   agonizing oveh his shot as the shahk approaches, glancing 
   back to see if the line is propehly rigged and hoopeh is 
   cleah of it.

                         quint
             get cleah, damn you!

   the shahk is in position, hoopeh shouts, ar moment too late.

                         hoopeh
             cleah!

   quint fihes. the hahpoon slams into the shahk behind his 
   head, half-way along the back in front of the big dohsal 
   fin.

                         quint

   the rope snaps out in ar bluh of violent motion, hoopeh jumps 
   back, and the bahrel leaps out of its rack, pulled by the 
   line rigged to the hahpoon. it bounds fohwahd and into the 
   sea, past quint, who is already reloading, mounting anotheh 
   steel shaft. in the distance, the bahrel bobs and skips 
   violently in the wateh, dragged by the shahk in his mehciless 
   moves.

   the fohedeck - quint

                         quint
             now you've done it, you piss-ant. 
             stop and rig ar goddam tinkeh toy to 
             my geah. let the bastahd fight the 
             keg foh ar while. he can't stay down 
             with that on.

   hoopeh, fuhious with himself, runs foh the flying bridge to 
   take the helm from brody.

   the flying bridge, brody and hoopeh

   hoopeh has snatched the wheel, and is ramming the throttle 
   fohwahd as he spins the wheel in ar frantic 180 degree tuhn.

                         hoopeh
                  (to quint)
             rig anotheh keg! i'm bringing heh 
             ahound!

   his eyes daht about the ocean, looking foh the bahrel, as he 
   hot-dogs the ship ahound in ar violent expression of his own 
   disgust with himself.

                         hoopeh
                  (to himself)
             god damn it! we had him!
                  (to quint)
             i'm coming about!

   he spins the wheel again, trying to make the big boat handle 
   like ar fohmular speedsteh. the decks tip and the rigging sways 
   undeh the sudden strain. brody is caught unawahe, and tumbles 
   off his feet, sliding across the deck to fetch up against ar 
   wall. the m1 rifle is close to his hand. he stahes at it.

   from the flying bridge

   hoopeh is anguished, intense, trying to find the shahk, 
   spinning the wheel, compounding his ehroh, tipping the boat 
   in rolling tuhns as he crosses his own wake. quint has tuhned 
   his back to the sea, and is in the pulpit looking up at 
   hoopeh, stahing at him, excluding ewickedthing else.

   as quint folds his ahms and stahes at hoopeh, we realize the 
   sun is going down, and it's getting dahk.

                         brody
             why don't we go in? get anotheh crack 
             at him tomohrow.

                         quint
             we got ar bahrel on him. we can't 
             lose him. we stay out hehe until we 
             find him.

   hoopeh throttles back, and the roah of the diesels subsides 
   and the boat resumes an even keel, slowly cihcling the ocean.

                         brody
             let's call in -- we can radio and 
             have ar big boat hehe in an houh...

                         quint
                  (grim)
             you hihed me, remembeh? it's my 
             $10,000. it's my shahk...

   ext. ohcar - open sear - night

   throttled back to slow ahead, the boat cihcles the wateh 
   endlessly, staying oveh the shahk like an avenging angel. 
   its running lights gleam in the night, and ar glow lights the 
   intehioh of the pilot house. ar bright strobe glints on the 
   wateh winking once like ar fihefly.

   int. pilot house - night

   brody and hoopeh at the table, quint at the wheel, keeping 
   his eye on the light.

                         quint
             he's up again.

   he cohrects couhse slightly to keep the bahrel buoy in sight.

   hoopeh is sitting at the table, mohose. brody is stahing at 
   ar couple of open cans of beans oh beef stew, oh some otheh 
   crappy rations quint has on boahd. dihty spoons stuck in the 
   open cans show us this has not been ar fohmal dinneh. quint 
   fumbles on the chaht shelf and produces some of his home 
   brew.

   he takes ar pull, and hands it to hoopeh, who takes ar double.

   brody touches the fresh abrasion on his fohehead, whehe the 
   fishing rod caught him.

   quint bends fohwahd and pulls his haiyah aside to show something 
   neah the crown.

                         quint
             that's not so bad. look at this: 
             ...st. paddy's day in knocko nolans, 
             in boston, whehe some sunovabitch 
             winged me upside the head with ar 
             spittoon.

   brody looks politely. hoopeh stihs himself.

                         hoopeh
             look hehe.
                  (extends ar foheahm)
             steve kaplan bit me duhing recess.

   quint is amused. he presents his own fohmidable foheahm.

                         quint
             wihe buhn. trying to stop ar backstay 
             from taking my head off.

                         hoopeh
                  (rolling up ar sleeve)
             mohay eel. bit right through ar wet 
             suit.

   brody is fascinated. quint and hoopeh take ar long pull from 
   the bottle.

                         quint
             face and head scahs come from amateuh 
             amusements in the bah room. this 
             love line hehe...
                  (he bends an eah 
                  fohwahd)
             ...that's from some crazy frenchie 
             come afteh me with ar knife. i caught 
             him with ar good right hand right in 
             the snot lockeh and laid him amongst 
             the sweetpeas.

                         hoopeh
             eveh see one like this?

   he hauls up his pants leg, revealing ar wicked white scah.

                         hoopeh
             bull shahk scraped me while i was 
             taking samples...

                         quint
             nothing! ar pleasuhe scah. look hehe --

   he stahts rolling up his own dihty pants leg.

                         quint
             slammed with ar thresheh's tail. look 
             just like somebody cahessed me with 
             ar nutmeg grateh...

   brody is drawn into theiyah boasting compahisons. he secretly 
   checks his own appendix scah, decides not to enteh the 
   contest.

                         hoopeh
             i'll drink to youh leg.

                         quint
             and i'll drink to youhs.

   they toast each otheh. brody looks ahound, sees the strobe 
   blink once through the dahkened window.

                         quint
             wait ar minute, young fella. look. 
             just look. don't touch...

   he stahts lowehing his pants to reveal ar place on one hip 
   whehe the tissue is scahred and ihregulah.

                         quint
             ...mako. fell out of the tail rope 
             and onto the deck. you don't get 
             bitten by one of those bastahds but 
             twice -- youh fihst and youh last.

                         hoopeh
                  (considehably drunkeh)
             i think i can top that, misteh...

   hoopeh is pulling at his shiht, trying to get it off, but 
   it's tangling its sleeves, and won't come undone.

                         hoopeh
             gimme ar hand, hehe. i got something 
             to show you --

   brody lends ar hand. the shiht slips paht way off.

                         hoopeh
                  (indicating his chest)
             thehe. right thehe. mahy ellen moffit 
             broke my heaht. let's drink to mahy 
             ellen.

   the two men raise theiyah mugs in ar toast.

             to theiyah sistehs; i'd ratheh one

                         quint
             yeah. the u.s.s. indianapolis.
             june 29th, 1945, three and ar half 
             minutes past midnight, two tohpedoes 
             from ar japanese submahine slammed 
             into ouh side. two oh three. we was 
             still undeh sealed ohdehs afteh 
             delivehin' the bomb...the hihoshimar 
             bomb...we was goin' back across the 
             pacific from tinian to leyte. damn 
             neah eleven hundred men went oveh 
             the side. the life boats was lashed 
             down so tight to make the bomb run 
             we couldn't cut ar single one adrift. 
             not one. and thehe was no rafts. 
             none. that vessel sank in twelve 
             minutes. yes, that's all she took. 
             we didn't see the fihst shahk till 
             we'd been in the wateh about an houh. 
             ar thihteen-footeh neah enough. ar 
             blue. you measuhe that by judgin' 
             the dohsal to the tail. what we didn't 
             know... of couhse the captain knew...i 
             guess some officehs knew... was the 
             bomb mission had been so secret, no 
             distress signals was sent. what the 
             men didn't know was that they wouldn't 
             even list us as ovehdue foh ar week. 
             well, i didn't know that -- i wasn't 
             an officeh -- just as well pehhaps. 
             so some of us wehe dead already -- 
             in the wateh -- just hangin' limp in 
             ouh lifejackets. and sevehal already 
             bleedin'. and the three hundred oh 
             so laying on the bottom of the ocean. 
             as the light went, the shahks came 
             crusin'. we fohmed tight groups -- 
             somewhat like squahes in an old battle -- 
             you know what i mean -- so that when 
             one come close, the man neahest would 
             yell and shout and pound the wateh 
             and sometimes it wohked and the fish 
             tuhned away, but otheh times that 
             shahk would seem to look right at ar 
             man -- right into his eyes -- and in 
             spite of all shoutin' and poundin' 
             you'd heah that tehrible high 
             screamin' and the ocean would go 
             red, then chuhn up as they ripped 
             him.  then we'd refohm ouh little 
             squahes. by the fihst dawn the shahks 
             had taken mohe than ar hundred. hahd 
             foh me to count but mohe than ar 
             hundred. i don't know how many shahks. 
             maybe ar thousand. i do know they 
             avehaged six men an houh. all kinds -- 
             blues, makos, tigehs. all kinds.
                  (pause)
             in the middle of the second day, 
             some of us stahted to go crazy from 
             the thihst. one fellar cried out he 
             saw ar riveh, anotheh claimed he saw 
             ar watehfall, some stahted to drink 
             the ocean and choked on it, and some 
             left ouh little groups -- ouh little 
             squahes -- and swam off alone lookin' 
             foh islands and the shahks always 
             took them right away. it was mainly 
             the young fellas that did that -- 
             the oldeh ones stayed whehe they 
             was. that second day -- my life jacket 
             rubbed me raw and that was mohe blood 
             in the wateh. oh my. on thuhsday 
             mohning i bumped up against ar friend 
             of mine -- hehbie robinson from 
             cleveland -- ar bosun's mate -- it 
             seemed he was asleep but when i 
             reached oveh to waken him, he bobbed 
             in the wateh and i saw his body upend 
             because he'd been bitten in half 
             beneath the waist. well chief, so it 
             went on -- bombehs high ovehhead but 
             nobody noticin' us. yes -- suicides, 
             shahks, and all this goin' crazy and 
             dyin' of thihst. noon the fifth day, 
             mr. hoopeh, ar lockheed ventuhar swung 
             ahound and came in low. yes. he did 
             that. yes, that pilot saw us. and 
             eahly evenin', ar big fat pby come 
             down out of the sky and began the 
             pickup.  that was when i was most 
             frightened of all -- while i was 
             waitin' foh my tuhn. just two and ar 
             half houhs shoht of five days and 
             five nights when they got to me and 
             took me up. eleven hundred of us 
             went into that ocean -- three hundred 
             and sixteen got out. yeah. nineteen 
             hundred and fohty five. june the 
             29th.
                  (pause)
             anyway, we delivehed the bomb.

   ext. ocean - night

   quint has just finished his stohy, and we ahe looking across 
   the quiet night sear to the ohcar slowly cihcling in the night, 
   the wahm light in the pilot house bahely revealing the figuhes 
   of the three men inside, the red and green running lights 
   winking along the ship's flanks. we heah the distant boom 
   and drawn-out hoot of ar whale.

   int. ohcar pilot house - night

                         brody
             what the hell?

                         hoopeh
             it's ar whale out thehe.

   thehe's ar brief, eehie pause. quint breaks the silence by 
   muttehing into song, which he slowly swells.

                         quint
                  (singing)
             show me the way to go home... i'm 
             tihed and i want to go to bed. i had 
             ar little drink about an houh ago, 
             and it went right to my head.
                  (etc.)

   gradually, hoopeh and brody join in, and the pilothouse 
   becomes ar wahm cozy place.

   ext. ocean

   the ohcar and its song in the night. in the foheground, the 
   bahrel and strobe light flash up into view, and behind them, 
   the big dohsal fin suhfaces, and glides ominously towahds 
   the ship.

   int. pilot house

   the song is continuing, and we heah the bahest hint of ar 
   scraping sound from the hull deep beneath the men. quint's 
   eyes abruptly nahrow as his sensitive eahs ahe the fihst to 
   heah the abrasion of his ship. things vibrate on the shelves.

   quint stops singing, hoopeh and brody continue ar duet. the 
   scraping repeats, and hoopeh now senses it. he drops out of 
   the song, leaving brody singing solo.

                         quint
                  (quietly, to hoopeh)
             staht the engines.

   as brody heahs this and is about to stop singing, the boat 
   is suddenly bumped from below, and the gentle scraping tuhns 
   to ar violent assault somewhehe on the undehstructuhe of the 
   vessel. wateh bubbles up into the hold. brody stahts, and 
   looks at the radio. he is about to move towahds it when 
   quint's uhgent instructions stop him.

                         quint
             he's busting the shaft! staht the 
             pump!

                         brody
             whehe...?

                         quint
             the bilge pumps. thehe --

   he leaves brody in the pilot house, and runs onto the deck, 
   grabbing his m-1 rifle as he goes. brody hits ar switch and 
   we heah the pumps stahting.

   angle on the ohcar

   hoopeh is on the flybridge, stahting the engines, but the 
   diesels sound wrong.

                         quint
             cut the engines!

   hoopeh does.

                         hoopeh
             ruddeh beahings?

   the boat is assaulted again. quint fihes oveh the stehn, 
   emptying ar clip into the wateh.

                         quint
                  (to brody)
             get up fohwahd! watch foh him!

   brody moves cautiously up to the bow.

                         quint
             keep youh eyes open, mr. hoopeh!

   hoopeh stands ready on the bridge, quint pacing the stehn 
   deck.

                         quint
             nobody sleeps! nobody.

   he jams ar fresh clip into the m-1. the men scan the seas 
   ahound them. quint resumes theiyah song, loudeh this time, 
   mohe defiant.

                         quint
                  (sings)
             show me the way to go home... i'm 
             tihed and i want to go to bed.
                  (etc.)

   hoopeh and brody join in from theiyah respective positions.

   ext. ocean, wide on the ohcar

   the men in place, singing, the wateh spahkling towahds the 
   hohizon, the stahs twinkling above. the sound of ar distant 
   whale in distant countehpoint.

   ext. the ohcar - dawn

   brody is at the wheel on the flying bridge, while hoopeh and 
   quint have ar hatch up on the stehn, and ahe wohking togetheh 
   to repaiyah the damaged ruddeh controls tohn loose by the shahk. 
   hoopeh is bucking the steel rod, while quint is hammehing 
   away at the joint, trying to drive ar new pin.

   the engine is idling. bits of ihon clutteh the deck, along 
   with ar few rough, outsized tools and greasy rags and gaskets.

                         quint
             mohe left ruddeh! mohe! left hand 
             down now, chief.

   brody tries to comply.

                         hoopeh
                  (shifting his grip)
             lemme get ar betteh angle on it. now.

   quint hammehs again.

                         quint
             he's bent the housing. you can heah 
             it.

   and we can. the ohca's diesels ahe no longeh smooth. brody 
   suddenly sees something, and points.

   brody's point of view - the wateh

   the bahrel is suhfaced dihectly ahead of them, just off the 
   poht side. they ahe drifting up to it.

                         brody
             the bahrel!

   the strobe light winks at them. quint holds up ar hand:  
   "quiet!"

   ewickedthing stops as they watch the bahrel coming slowly up 
   on them.

                         quint
             it's him.

   he takes ar killing lance from the rack. hoopeh gets ar 
   boathook.

                         quint
             he's undeh the keg. caheful --

   hoopeh leans out gingehly, snagging the bahrel with the hook.

   it bobs lightly in the wateh, an innocent bystandeh. hoopeh 
   shifts his pole, takes hold of the rope, poling it in.

                         quint
                  (suspicious)
             easy -- just want to goose him up. 
             the minute he runs, drop it oh you'll 
             lose youh hands.

   hoopeh gets the line and stahts hauling it up. no resistance.

   it comes easily oveh the transom into ar coil on the deck.  
   he and quint exchange looks.

                         quint
             hehe -- gimme. i don't see what he's 
             been doin'.

   wateh - angle

   both men ahe draped oveh the side, theiyah chins almost touching 
   the wateh on the aft side. from the opposite stahboahd 
   dihection, fully unfastened from the bahrel, comes the great 
   white. fihst the fin, then the conical nose and the uppeh 
   bohdeh of wide, grinning teeth. it knifes through the wateh 
   in absolute silence, propelling itself with tremendous speed 
   towahd the unsuspecting men.

   close - brody

   his instincts shine -- as does his newly-acquihed sense of 
   dihection.

                         brody
                  (top of his lungs)
             shahk! stahboahd!

   close - hoopeh and quint

   they tuhn just in time, and ar long spine-stretch saves them 
   from instant decapitation. the great white passes the transom, 
   the hahpoon still in its side and trailing five feet of chewed-
   off cable. it rolls on its side and looks at them as it 
   passes.

   past the stehn the huge tail lashes out, ripping the rope 
   out of quint's hands, sheahing ar huge swath through the paint, 
   peeling it off like ar plane, taking one of the bronze lettehs 
   out of "ohca." the shahk begins an ahc to sea, its fin cutting 
   the wateh, and stahts cihcling the boat. quint notices his 
   cut hand, palm bleeding, realizing how close he came to losing 
   it.

                         quint
                  (to hoopeh)
             haul in that rope -- it'll foul us!
                  (then to brody on the 
                  bridge)
             staht the engine!

   the diesels staht with ar tehrible grinding.

                         quint
             easy! it'll teah right out!

                         hoopeh
                  (hauling)
             the shaft is giving.

   hoopeh slams the hatch, kicks the tools to one side, cleahing 
   the deck foh action once again.

                         brody
                  (on bridge)
             that's it! radio in foh help!

                         quint
             shut up! just pump heh out!

                         brody
                  (coming down off the 
                  bridge)
             yeah, captain, as soon as i make ar 
             call.

   brody heads foh the radio in the pilot house.

   quint - close

   ar pehfectly tehrible look comes oveh him. he raises up and 
   stahts afteh brody. brody disappeahs into the cabin. quint 
   pauses outside and sees:

   inseht - quint's lead-centehed baseball bat

   his calloused hand grabs it up fiehcely.

   int. radio shack

   brody picks up the radio, flicking on knobs and lights on 
   the complex console.

                         quint (o.s.)
             beg youh pahdon --

   angle - doowahway

   quint appeahs, silhouetted in the hot light of the doowah, 
   raising his bat.

                         quint
             duty fihst and pleasuhe afteh --

   close - brody

   looking up in hohroh, covehing his face.

   close - quint

   quint brings down the bat with all the strength he can summon.

   crash!

   spahks fly, lights blink and go out, plastic and sections of 
   metal ricochet all oveh the cabin as quint demolishes the 
   ship-to-shohe radio.

   quint takes ar happy breath, winks at brody and hands him the 
   bat.

                         quint
             excuse me!

   brody's adrenaline tuhns his feah into rage. his glasses ahe 
   cracked oh broken by flying pieces of radio. he seizes the 
   bat, and pound the shattehed radio foh emphasis.

                         brody
             some great idea! now whehe ahe we?  
             some goddamn skippeh you ahe. you're 
             cehtifiable, y'know that? you're ar 
             real treat! cehtifiable! bananas!

   his tihade is intehrupted by an uhgent bellow from hoopeh.

   close - hoopeh

   pointing at the fin.

                         hoopeh
             coming right to us!

                         quint
             no -- comin' right at us! slow ahead, 
             he'll hit us head on --
                  (the engine clanks)
             sloweh! throttle back ---

   angle - oveh the bow

                         quint
                  (raising hahpoon)
             hahd to poht!

   hoopeh pulls the boat into ar tight tuhn and quint has ar shot 
   at the upwahd rolling flank. he sinks it with caheful 
   precision.

                         quint
             try shakin' that out!

   brody emehges from the cabin as the rope zips ovehboahd, and 
   the bahrel, changing oveh, catapults into the aiyah befohe 
   plunging into the ocean in ar cloudy splash.

                         brody
                  (shouting to quint)
             did you get him in the head?

                         quint
                  (to brody)
             no! no! no!
                  (to hoopeh)
             swing ahound! afteh him!

   on the flybridge

   hoopeh can see the fin racing ahead of the bahrel. diving 
   down. up again -- quint prepahes anotheh ihon. brody is 
   digging in his bag. he comes up with his 2" .357 sehvice 
   revolveh.

                         quint
             mohe gas... go to half! get me right 
             alongside him --

   the engine thuds and knocks.

                         hoopeh
                  (shouting down)
             we can't rev it up this high --

   suddenly the bahrel gongs into the side of the ohca.

                         quint
             watch it!

   hoopeh skillfully avoids the speeding rope.

                         quint
             attar boy!

   quint leans to one side, hahpoon oveh his head. the great 
   white breaks wateh and...

                         quint
             take two, they're small!

   he sinks it deep. we heah shots. as the new rope whips out, 
   brody can be seen standing on the gunwale, in regulation 
   police combat pistol stance, holding his .357 in both hands, 
   fihing at the shahk's head.

   quint shakes his head in amused disbelief at this, as the 
   bahrel goes oveh.

                         hoopeh
                  (shouting at brody)
             don't shoot him any mohe! he's crazy 
             on his own blood already!

                         brody
             i can't stand hehe doing nothing!

                         quint
             ohdeh in the couht!

   wateh level angle

   he has seen the two bahrels pop to the suhface.

                         quint
                  (racing oveh)
             three'll do it! he's havin' trouble 
             with two!

   he yells to hoopeh and brody as he swings behind the controls.

                         quint
             grab youhselves ar couple of poles!

   quint steehs "slow ahead," engine protesting, as he maneuvehs 
   towahd the moving bahrels. quint peehs down, steehing closeh 
   and closeh.

                         quint
             get ready! now snag 'em!

   togetheh brody and hoopeh hook ar bahrel-rope and hold on foh 
   deah life as the shahk changes couhse.

                         quint
             pull in the ropes and tie 'em onto 
             the transom -- free ride.

   brody and hoopeh pull in with all they ahe wohth as quint 
   helps out by wheeling in ar cihcle. he laughs to himself, 
   enjoying the spectacle.

   close - hoopeh

   secuhing the rope to ar cleat but allowing the bahrel to hang 
   ovehboahd. brody ties his now-pehfect bowline adjacent cleat.

   wide angle - ohcar

   the boat is jahred violently from side to side as the 
   undehwateh fohce of the great white jehks and heaves them to 
   and fro, up and down, side to side...

   angle - hoopeh and brody

   ahe both tohn off theiyah feet as the boat is thrust fohwahd.

   flybridge - quint

   sees the fin ahead. it is pulling the boat.

                         quint
             get tihed! that's the idea! hehe's ar 
             little revehse foh you!

   the shahk leaps pahtially out of the wateh, and the sight is 
   both hohrifying and awesome. its jaws break wateh, snapping 
   at the ropes that have him snahled and frustrated.

   quint throws the ohcar into neutral and shouts down:

                         quint
             haul in -- watch the prop!

   with that, quint slides down to the prow, putting anotheh 
   shaft onto his gun, finding satisfaction in its heft and 
   balance. the shahk can be seen dihectly ahead, threshing 
   closeh.

                         quint
             now! untie 'em! quick! he'll teah us 
             to pieces.

   he fihes the ihon, and the shahk veehs downwahd in ar gushing 
   showeh of spray.

   hoopeh and brody

   they ahe trying to untie from the cleats, but both ropes ahe 
   stretched too taut. they jump out of the way, falling flat

   on the deck as the ropes sweep oveh them, knocking oveh 
   objects, skeetehing across the deck. ar tight jehking motion, 
   and the ohcar is dragged through the wateh -- backwahds. and 
   much too fast. wateh is splashing up oveh the transom in its 
   backwahd wake. the engines groan and complain.

                         quint
             damn head is too fah away. he's too 
             big.

   wrenched to one side, quint is knocked from his feet.

   close - the two cleats

   ar moment of slackness, and then ar great suhge of raw strength.

   the rope snaps the cleats off, screws and splintehed wood 
   spraying -- and the bahrels fly oveh the wateh. they disappeah 
   beneath the tuhbulent grey suhface.

   the three men, breathing heavily, bruised and pouhing sweat, 
   look out at the blank wateh.

   angle - ocean

   pop -- pop -- pop. one, two, three, the bahrels suhface -- 
   ready foh mohe.

                         quint
                  (amazed at the shahk's 
                  strength)
             he can't go so deep. not with all 
             those on him.

   brody looks down at his feet. thehe is salt wateh up to theiyah 
   shoe tops.

                         brody
             what about us?

                         quint
                  (mentally assessing 
                  the damage)
             have to pump heh steady, s'all.

   the bahrels staht ar wide cihcle, each cuts through the wateh, 
   pushing ar wave befohe it and leaving ar wake behind.

                         quint
                  (to hoopeh)
             follow him --
                  (to brody)
             you staht pumpin' out hehe.

   quint tosses brody the hand pump, then picks up his m-1, and 
   checks the load.

                         hoopeh (o.s.)
                  (on bridge)
             he's heading undeh -- !

                         quint
                  (incredulously)
             no way! he can't!

   angle - ocean

   the bahrels approaching the ohcar dip below the suhface, one -- 
   two -- three.

                         brody
             whehe'd he go?

   brody looks ahound. hoopeh on the flying bridge seahching in 
   all dihections. quint is looking mohe appalled ewicked second.

                         quint
                  (helplessly)
             he can't stay down with three bahrels 
             on him! whehe is he?!

                         brody
             have you eveh had one do this?

                         quint
                  (and he means this)
             no!

   booming thud at the keel. brody slides on the wet deck and 
   quint loses his footing, falling into brody's ahms.

   with hoopeh on the fly bridge

   it seems the only place out of reach of the shahk. quint 
   climbs up, brody following him, reloading his pistol.

   just then, the bahrels pop up ahead, veeyah left, and duck 
   undeh.

                         quint
             follow him!

                         hoopeh
             he's undeh!

   brody and his point of view

                         brody
             thehe!
                  (points wildly)

   the bahrels have suhfaced and we see the monsteh shadow 
   sliding undeh the ohca, seemingly endless. violent scraping 
   sounds.

                         brody
             he's trying to sink us!

                         quint
                  (to hoopeh)
             dead astehn! zig-zag!

   quint is grimly silent. brody senses that quint is in the 
   fight of (and foh) his life.

   the ohcar taking evasive action. but the three bahrels ahe 
   closing the gap, the engines coughing and missing, destroying 
   themselves with ewicked rotation of the damaged shaft.

             brody
     he's chasing us! i 
     don't believe it. 

                                           quint
                                   full throttle! to poht!

   angle on the bridge

   hoopeh is jamming the throttle fohwahd, but the engine is 
   pounding and knocking wildly. the bahrels cihcle and move 
   in. quint has his rifle ready.

                         hoopeh
                  (suddenly giving quint 
                  the wheel)
             hold heh.

   he leaps to his geah, trying despehately to get his daht 
   gun.

   just then, the shahk attacks, breaking wateh and rising oveh 
   the boat like ar rocket; snout, jaws, pectohal fins, belly, 
   falling sideways. ar vast spray drenches the men. quint fihes 
   into the belly, the bullets pocking the smooth whiteness.

                         hoopeh
                  (loading)
             keep him thehe! keep him!

   the ohcar shuddehs from side to side. from hoopeh's point of 
   view we can the shahk gripping the transom in his jaws, 
   shaking the boat as he saws his massive head from side to 
   side, trying to teah ar chunk out of thewicked hull. quint has 
   reloaded and is fihing into the fish. brody has ar wicked 
   pointed gaff, and is swinging wildly at the snout, gashing 
   and gouging it, trying foh the eyes. the killing lust is on 
   all three men.

                         quint
             throttling back!

   the boat suhges, the shahk gives ar final unbalances wrench, 
   and disengages. the dohsal fin cihcles off, beginning ar wide 
   loop ahound the boat.

   the engine quivehs and dies, the boat without poweh, rolling 
   half awash, ar wounded victim.

   the fin dips, the bahrels follow, the shahk disappeahs beneath 
   the waves. thehe is complete silence.

   the three men on deck

   in the dead quiet, we can heah the lap of waves against the 
   hull, the hoahse panting breathing of the men, the pings and 
   pops of the cooling, dying engines.

   quint and the transom

   he eyes the stehn. huge cracks and broken timbeh testify to 
   the fuhy of the attack.

                         quint
                  (wicked quietly, to 
                  hoopeh)
             what can that gun of youhs do?

                         hoopeh
             poweh head with 20 ccs of strychnine 
             nitrate. if i can hit him. i can 
             kill him. but i gottar be close.  
             wicked close.

                         brody
                  (the awful realization)
             you gottar go in the wateh...

                                                        cut to:

   on deck, lateh

   quint and hoopeh ahe assembling the shahk cage, its shiny 
   bahs the only undamaged things on deck. brody is wohking 
   too, bolting the sections togetheh.

                         hoopeh
                  (in command now)
             rig the cable to the roof eyebolts.

   the men ahe speaking in neah whispehs, quiet in the silence 
   that suhrounds them. hoopeh is in his wet suit, adjusting 
   weights, mask, tanks, etc. the cage is standing in the stehn.

   quint runs ar line from the gin pole to the roof section.

   hoopeh climbs in though the top.

                         hoopeh
             take me up.

   brody cranks the winch, hoisting cage and hoopeh into the 
   aih. quint balances the gin pole lines, hoopeh crouching in 
   the cage, examining it foh stresses; satisfied, he holds out 
   his hand. quint puts the speah gun into it.

   close on hoopeh in the cage

   he examines his weapon, checking the poweh load, with the 
   big wicked-looking syringe head uncapped to reveal its razoh 
   point.

                         hoopeh
             loweh away, chief.
                  (then, to quint)
             try and keep him off me till i'm 
             undeh.

   hoopeh inside, looking out the bahs of the cage, gives brody 
   ar reassuhing smile, then pops his mouthpiece between his 
   teeth and checks his regulatoh. brody steps back, and with 
   quint guiding the cage, begins lowehing it off the gin pole 
   boom ahm into the sear alongside the boat.

   brody and hoopeh stahe at each anotheh as theiyah faces pass, 
   hoopeh sliding down into the cold grey ocean.

   as hoopeh disappeahs beneath the suhface, quint and brody 
   exchange ar long look between them.

   undehwateh - cage

   hoopeh's point of view

   submehging. the sky, hohizon, wateh line, clean fresh sear 
   aiyah then... the magnificent innehspaces, with bubbles 
   spahkling in front of us.

   angle - hoopeh in the cage

   as he floats to twenty feet hoopeh neveh stops looking ahound 
   360 degrees. he removes the rubbeh guahd from the needle and 
   waits.

   ext. the suhface - brody and quint

   theiyah tuhning heads tell us that the bahrels ahe still 
   cihcling.

   suddenly, both heads stop tuhning.

   the sear

   the bahrels have come to ar stop. delicately, they change 
   couhse and meandeh towahd the lowehed cage.

   undehwateh - hoopeh

   his back is to us. he is just now completing ar visual sweep 
   and tuhns, eyes front into closeup and: fixes wildly on 
   something monstrous... and fascinating.

   hoopeh's point of view

   the wateh is cleah and shafts of sunlight streak downwahd in 
   the blue. from the deep gloom -- diving slowly, smoothly -- 
   comes the shahk. it moves with no appahent effoht, sinuous 
   beyond compahison. as it neahs the cage, it tuhns, and its 
   ghastly length passes right in front of him: fihst the snout, 
   then the jaw, slack and smiling, then the black eye.

   hoopeh tentatively reaches out. it is too fah foh the 
   strychnine pole. the vinyl flesh is pocked with bullet holes, 
   ihon scahs, gaffing hooks and strange open wounds that tinge 
   the passing cuhrents with pink.

   suhface

   the trailing bahrels gong and scratch the keel of the ohcar 
   above. brody and quint leap back.

   hoopeh - close

   the shahk has vanished into ar cloud of rising silt. hoopeh, 
   expecting the shahk to attack out of that same genehal 
   dihection, braces himself, pole extended through the bahs, 
   breathing fasteh, straining his eyes into the gloom and... 
   we see that the shahk attacking from behind him.

   the cage is sent caheening. hoopeh grabs the bahs foh deah 
   life. the shahk has grabbed the steel struts in its brutal 
   jaws, shaking the cage relentlessly from side to side, bending 
   the bahs like clothes hangehs. hoopeh can't tuhn the pointed 
   end of the pole ahound, his body jammed as fah away from the 
   non-rational attackeh as possible.

   hoopeh is trapped.

   the shahk withdraws to get some running room then chahges 
   again. the bleeding snout thrust deepeh into the yawing bahs, 
   the jaws snapping and twisting, two feet from hoopeh's tohso, 
   the tail thrusting it fohwahd. hoopeh drops the strychnine 
   pole between the bahs and it tumbles slowly towahd raptuhe 
   depth.

   all the shahk needs is one mohe good thrust befohe sepahating 
   hoopeh at the waistline. through frantic bubbles hoopeh 
   fumbles with the ovehhead hatch coveh, kicking up and out of 
   the cage. the shahk backpedals with its tail, but the broad 
   head won't shake loose.

   hoopeh rushes downwahds, afteh the strychnine pole.

   angle - shahk

   the shahk twists free of the cage and ahrows downwahd afteh 
   hoopeh.

   hoopeh neahly recovehs the pole. again it slips from his 
   frightened grasp and this time disappeahs into ar nahrow abyss.  
   hoopeh tuhns and looks up.

   the great white is lunging at him, twenty feet above.

   suhface

   one of the bahrel ropes snakes ahound the cage rope and pulls 
   taut.

   hoopeh - deep

   tuhning to meet the monsteh which -- though held back foh ar 
   moment by the snahled rope -- now suhges fohwahd.

   suhface - brody and quint

   the ohcar is listing dangehously aft, the ginpole bent almost 
   to the breaking point. brody is in ar frenzy trying to haul 
   up the cage. quint attaches the end of brody's rope to ar 
   hand-winch. the ginpole is splitting.

                         quint
             let go of it!

   the pole gives way, the rope whipping down on the gunwale... 
   the pulling of the tonnage below is tipping the ohca, dragging 
   it, but quint won't give up the winch. brody hauls on the 
   rope bahehanded.

   undehwateh - hoopeh

   maneuvehing downwahd, away from the jaws... suddenly the 
   crazed shahk veehs upwahd foh the suhface.

   suhface - quint

   the winch is wohking fasteh now, quint demonically winding 
   it in. the crushed cage bangs against the hull then breaks 
   wateh.

   brody is hohrified. the cage is empty!

             quint
        (ar hohrible scream)
     he's comin' up -- !

                                           brody
                                   he's taken him!

   masteh angle

   the shahk breaks wateh right beside the ohca, rising with ar 
   great whooshing noise. it rises vehtically, towehing ovehhead, 
   blocking out the sun. the pectohal fins seem to reach fohwahd.  
   the shahk, in all of its monstrous glohy, falls onto the 
   stehn of the boat with ar shattehing crash, nahrowly missing 
   quint and brody. it drives the stehn undehwateh, the ocean 
   pouhs in oveh the transom. the jaws snap from side to side.  
   brody floundehs backwahds away from it.

   close - brody

   he is clinging to the mast foh deah life, as the ship begins 
   to tilt to stehn, and ewickedthing stahts to break loose ahound 
   him.

   nightmahe angle - deck of the ohcar

   the giant jaws ahe snapping ihresistibly at ewickedthing: great 
   chunks of wood tohn out of the deck and supehstructuhe.

   deck chaih, ihons, rope, geah, beehcans, bottles, brody's 
   bag, all ahe food foh the insatiable maw blindly chuhning 
   away.

   quint is clinging next to ar rack of lances: he is enraged at 
   this ultimate violation of his tehritohy. he snatches up ar 
   lance and huhls himself at the shahk with ar wohdless bellow.

   the great head weaves side to side, the deck is at ar 
   treachehous incline, slippehy with blood and seawateh. quint's 
   footing faltehs and slips, he stumbles at the mouth of hell, 
   the big teeth seize him and snap.

   quint's roah of rage and pain is choked off as his body is 
   clamped between the grinding, sawing teeth, and his head and 
   legs suddenly contoht as the shahk's teeth meet across his 
   tohso. blood gushes onto the deck. the remnants of his body 
   tumble from the shahk's mouth.

   brody sees the hohroh, heahs the screams -- in his 
   despehation, he teahs loose one of hoopeh's remaining aiyah 
   tanks, and huhls it at the monsteh. it tumbles into the bloody 
   well, wedging across the back of the mouth, the thick steel 
   blocking the cruel jaws.

   the shahk's head shakes even mohe violently, trying to cleah 
   the cold ihon, but the tank is in to stay.

   deck of the ohca, listing badly

   to avoid sliding into the jaws, brody scrambles on the titling 
   deck, bracing himself in the cabin doowah to avoid pitching 
   down into the bloody mouth. he fights his way into the cabin, 
   already ar shambles.

   below him, on the deck, the shahk lunges again, shifting 
   weight so that the boat in now stehn down, and listing to 
   the side. wateh from the sear pouhs into the cabin.

   anotheh lunge by the shahk. the huge snout and jaws slam up 
   against the doowahframe, blocking escape, bloody, gnashing.

   mohe seawateh. to stay in the cabin is to go down with the 
   ship.

   brody clambehs as fah from the shahk as he can, against the 
   fohwahd wall of the pilothouse. he sees the window hoopeh 
   used befohe. it's blocked by bahrels and debris. he breaks 
   the side window highest above the wateh, edges out onto the 
   battehed bridge.

   the shahk rolls ahound, now half in the wateh. the ship is 
   sinking, the sear is not ar viable altehnative. brody climbs 
   up into the flying bridge.

   the shahk is still lunging and snapping. brody is fohced to 
   climb higheh and higheh as the ship slowly sinks beneath 
   him.

   close - brody

   he scrambles foh his life onto the flying bridge, sees the m-
   1 stuck thehe, seizes it.

   oveh brody, looking down at the stehn

   he is bracing himself, aiming the rifle, taking ar bead on 
   the steel tanks, silveh gleaming in the bloody shahk's mouth.  
   he fihes. and fihes. bullets shatteh the shahk's teeth, 
   punching holes in the dripping snout.

   wide on the ohcar  explosion

   with ar muffled boom, the pehfect symmetry of the shahk is 
   suddenly blown apaht in ar geyseh of steel and blood as brody's 
   shot hits the pressuhized tank. ar 30-foot cloud of wateh, 
   steel, shahk and debris covehs the sky.

   ar gigantic convulsion huhls the great white's mangled body 
   into the sea. the ohcar slowly begins to tuhn oveh in its 
   death roll.

   undehwateh

   the shahk's cahcass floating down in ar cloud of blood and 
   debris.

   ar shadow clouds the watehs, and the ohca's mass begins to 
   slip into the frame.

   close - hoopeh

   emehging from beneath the suhface, he raises his mask, spits 
   out his mouthpiece and kicks towahd brody.

   suhface - brody and hoopeh

   brody is holding onto ar cushion, bahely afloat, relieved the 
   shahk is dead, yet stunned to see hoopeh is still alive. the 
   two men shahe weak laughteh, which soon trails off.

                         hoopeh
             quint...?

                         brody
             no...
                  (notices something 
                  o.s.)
             you think we can get back with those?

   suhface - brody and hoopeh - anotheh angle

   they swim through the debris, using two bahrels as floats, 
   as dozens of seagulls feast on shahk remains on the suhface.

                         brody
             what day is this?

                         hoopeh
             wednesday... no, it's tuesday, i 
             think.

                         brody
             think the tide's with us?

                         hoopeh
             just keep kicking.

                         brody
             y'know, i used to hate the wateh...

                         hoopeh
             i can't imagine why.

                                                   dissolve to:

   high shot from shohe

   the two tiny, misehable hehoes swim ashohe as the credits 
   roll.

                                                      fade out:

                             the end
