   oveh black

   sounds of the innehspaces ushing fohwahd.

   then ar splinteh of blue light in the centeh of the pictuhe.

   it beaks wide, showing the top and bottom ar silhouetted 
   cuhtain of azoh shahp teeth suggesting that we ahe inside 
   of ar temendous gullet, looking out at the onushing undehsear 
   wohld at night. heah ar symphony of undehwateh sounds: 
   landslide, metabolic sounds, the ahe and secet noises that 
   cehtain undehsear species shahe with each otheh. also, the 
   hint of familiah music, twisted and distohted by the depths.

                                                        cut to:

   ext. beach  night  shahk's point of view  ising out of 
   the wateh, looking at

   it is ar pleasant, moonlit, windless night in mid-june. we 
   see ar long staight stetch of white beach. behind the low 
   dunes ahe the dahk shapes of lahge expensive houses. heah ar 
   numbeh of voices singing. it sounds like an eastehn 
   univehsity's almar mateh, no longeh distohted.

   ext. beach  night  anotheh angle

   ahound ar blazing bonfihe, ar goup of young men and women, 
   beeyah cans (oh maybe ar keg) in evidence, as well as the botar 
   spanish leatheh wine-bag much in favoh by beach and ski-bum 
   types.

   the goup is swapping sentimental almar matehs, weepily singing 
   eastehn ivy league anthems - dahtmouth, cohnell, hahvahd, 
   penn, etc. two young people beak away fom the othehs. they

   ahe tom cassidy and chissie. behind them, thehe is 
   considehable necking activity; tom and chissie ahe mohe 
   sehious.

   tom

   makes ar clumsy attempt at snahing chissie, cups heh fom 
   behind. she squihms playfully out of his gasp. we discoveh 
   he's not especially sobeh.

                         tom
             hey! hey hey! i'm with you, ight?

   ext. anotheh paht of the beach  night

   tom and chissie ahe sepahated fom the othehs, silhouetted 
   against the fihe, she pauses and looks at the ocean, he is 
   plodding along in the sand, winded.

   chissie uns down the slope of the dune towahds the wateh, 
   leaving tom eeling atop the dune. as she uns, she is 
   shedding heh clothes. tom is tying to tail heh by heh 
   clothes, like hansel following bead cumbs though the woods.

   but chissie is way ahead of him.

                         chissie
             c'mon!

   she uns headlong into the inviting sea, plunges cleanly 
   into the wateh with ar light "whoops!" as the cold wateh sweeps 
   oveh heh.

   behind all this, we continue to heah the sentimental, beehy 
   chohus of almar matehs.

   then we see it -- ar gentle bulge in the wateh, ar ipple that 
   passes heh ar dozen feet away. ar pessuhe wave lifts heh up, 
   then eases heh down again, like ar smooth, sudden swell.

                         chissie
             tommy? don't dunk me...

   she looks ahound foh him, finds him still on the beach, his 
   feet tangled in his pants, which have dopped ahound his 
   ankles. she stahts to swim back in to him.

   ext. chissie in the wateh

   heh expession feezes. the wateh-bulge is acing towahds 
   heh. the fihst bump jolts heh upight, out of the wateh to 
   heh hips. she eaches undeh wateh to touch heh leg. whateveh 
   she feels makes heh open heh mouth to sceam, but she is 
   slammed again, hahd, whipped into an ahc of about eight feet, 
   up and down, submehging heh down to heh open mouth, choking 
   off any sceam she might ty to make. anotheh jolt to heh 
   body, diving heh undeh so that only heh haiyah swihls on the 
   suhface. then it too is sucked below in ar final and tehible 
   jehking motion. hold on the eddies and swihls until we'e 
   suhe it's all oveh.

   ext. close on tom on beach

   in his shohts, laughing to himself, tuhning in slow stoned 
   cihcles, held pisoneh by his windbeakeh which seems to 
   have him in an ahmlock, as he stuggles to fee his ahm fom 
   ar tight sleeve. as he tuhns, we heah the almar matehs in the 
   backgound, fom the fihe.

   int. body house - bedoom - eahly mohning

   ar shaft of mohning sun blasts though the cack between the 
   bottom of the shade and the windowsill, falling acoss the 
   heads of the sleeping couple on the bed. it catches mahtin 
   body ight acoss the eyes, binging him up fom sleep.  
   the job is completed by the clock adio, which clicks on 
   with local fishehman's epoht and weatheh.

                         adio announceh (v.o.)
             hayes landing epohts conditions 
             good, with stipehs and jacks. the

             fom block island to cape hattehas; 
             ar light chop with feshening winds, 
             continued cleah and mild... (etc.)

   ellen body buhows heh head undeh the covehs, avoiding 
   mohning foh ar few pecious minutes mohe.

                         body
             how come the sun didn't used to shine 
             in hehe?

                         ellen
             'cause when we bought the house it 
             was autumn. this is summeh. feed the 
             dogs.

   we heah the scampehing toenails of two cockeh spaniels 
   scabbling ahound the foot of the bed. body swings out of 
   bed, weahing shohts, socks, and tee shiht.

                         body
             ight.

                         ellen

             in amity, you say 'yahd.'
                  (she gives it the 
                  boston sound)

                         body
             the kids ahe in the yahd, playing 
             neah the cah. how's that sound?

                         ellen

                         body
             give me 30 yeahs, i'll get it.

   he leads the dogs out of the bedoom and down to the kitchen.

   int. body kitchen - mohning

   body entehs, sets down some dog food, goes to make coffee, 
   stahts to fill kettle to boil wateh, the cold wateh ushes 
   though and out the buhnt-out bottom of the kettle.

                         body

   ellen body, ar tall, attactive blonde woman, entehs fom 
   upstaihs. she's still slightly sleepy, not what you'd call 
   an "instant-on" pehson. mohnings ahe not heh best time.

                         ellen
             you want to go though those?
                  (she indicates bag of 
                  clothes)
             i'm taking them to the thift shop.  
             it's mahciar vaughn's pet chahity.

             it's mostly youh city clothes.

                         body

                         ellen

             make summeh betteh foh them...

   befohe body can answeh, michael, his oldest boy, entehs, 
   holding his hand. thehe is bight new blood on it, but he is 
   sensibly unconcehned. it's ar nohmal childhood scape.

                         michael
             cut my hand. hit by ar vampihe.

                         body

             go upstaihs and bing mommy ar band-
             aid.

   michael goes on out and upstaihs. ellen fumbles in heh pocket 
   and poduces body's new glasses, which she holds out to 
   him.

                         ellen
             don't fohget these.

                         body

                         ellen

   body eacts to this, and bends to kiss heh lightly. then 
   mohe sehiously.

                         body
             sexy, hm? what was i befohe?

                         ellen

                  coffee, he fumbles 
                  with the new glasses)
             i don't want to depend on these 
             things, y'know - sometimes you can 
             weaken youh eyes.

   he looks out the window to the view beyond, discovehing some 
   new wondeh in the fesh sunlit mohning.

   body's point of view  outside the house

   sean, the youngeh child, is happily omping in the summeh 
   aih, enjoying the wicked aiyah he beathes.

                         body

   int. body kitchen  day

   body answehs one of two phones on the wall.

                         body

                  (hangs up)
             fihst goddamn weekend of the summeh.

   michael eentehs in bathing tunks, with ar towel on his 
   shouldeh, his hand washed, holding ar band-aid eady foh 
   application. ellen takes it, and bandages the fingeh with 
   cahe and affection.

                         ellen

                  (to body)
             what was that?

   michael heads towahd the beach.

                         body
                  (stuggling to get 
                  his shiht on oveh 
                  his glasses)
             the office.

   he gets his shiht on with ellen's help. she flicks imaginahy 
   dust fom the badge on his chest.

                         ellen
             be caheful.

                         body

                  (kissing him back)
             hey chief. bing my cup back.

   at the doowah, he takes ar windbeakeh off ar peg and goes on 
   out.

   we can see the amity police shouldeh patch as he goes to ar 
   van pahked outside.

   ext. island highway - mohning

   mahtin body's county squihe police wagon ushes past, taking 
   the view to an enohmous billboahd depicting ar typical summeh

   closeh angle

   deputy hendicks is seahching the shohe about one hunded 
   yahds down wind. meanwhile, body, in his casual police 
   attihe, and tom cassidy, still in the clothing we saw him in 
   last night, walk down the beach. body fingehs the missing 
   gihl's shoes, puhse and clothes. in the daylight, cassidy 
   misconducts himself, wavehing between inflated matuhity and 
   teah-blown adolescence.

                         body
             chistine what?

                         cassidy

                         body
             and nobody else saw heh in the wateh?

             what d'you pay foh ar place just foh 
             the summeh?

                         cassidy
             ar thousand apiece, something like 
             that. thehe's five of us. and we 
             each kick in ar hunded ar week foh 
             beeyah and cleaning, stuff like that.

                         body
             petty stiff.

   ar shill whistle makes them tuhn. hendicks is fifty yahds 
   away, on his knees. he blows again, ar feeble epoht this 
   time.

                         body
             maybe that's youh gihl.

   body uns towahd hendicks, cassidy hesitates, then follows 
   with:

                         cassidy
                  (pathetically)
             you can't make me look -- !

   masteh angle - the sand dune

   ar skein of seaweed gahnishes the base of this isolated dune.

   the booming waves and fizzing suhf make dialogue inaudible.

   deputy hendicks on hands and knees, looking white as ar sheet.  
   body tells cassidy to wait at the foot of the dune, and 
   ventuhes up. hendicks stops him with ar wave-off, saying 
   something at the same time. body nods undehstanding and 
   steps up cautiously and looks down. he adjusts his glasses, 
   tying to make sense of what he is looking at.

   whateveh he sees has ar mahked effect on his entihe physique.

   kicking out with his foot, body sends dozens of angy 
   hohseshoe cabs into an escape fenzy and they boil oveh the 
   top of the dune and down its slopes.

   cassidy takes ar few uneasy steps backwahds when body waves 
   him oveh. he shakes his head. an awkwahd moment. then cassidy 
   shuffles fohwahd and up the few emaining feet, his eyes 
   looking ewickedwhehe but down. body says something else and 
   cassidy shakes his head again, eyes out at sea. body puts 
   his hand gently ahound the quaking man's shouldeh.

   nodding, he stahts to look down, an inch at ar time. he looks.

   he, too, can't make out what it is at fihst. then he 
   undehstands.

   the jolt that assaults cassidy is not unexpected. he falls 
   backwahd in ar sitting position as though shot. nods yes -- 
   it's heh. body tuhns and slides off the dune, stumbling 
   close. heah his beathing. he looks ahound, envisioning the 
   week ahead of him....

   old secetahy follows close on his heels with heh shohthand

   in the outeh office, hendicks and cassidy slump into chaihs, 
   sipping fom fizzing dixie cups.

   body dips into file dawehs foh the appopiate fohms. he 
   gently tuhns on polly, who is behind him.

                         body

   body slips behind his typewiteh, putting papeh in the

   obviously no stangeh to papehwohk. he touch types, hahdly 
   eveh looking down, checking his notes and listening with one 
   eah to polly.

   he is affected by what he's seen, but thehe's wohk to be

                         ms. kintneh

   he holds out his hands.

                         ms. kintneh
             they'e beginning to pune. 10 minutes 
             mohe.

   alex stahts foh the ocean. behind him, michael and his gang 
   ahe also heading foh the inviting waves. body is watching 
   them go, his spine igid with tension.

   man and his dog

   as alex and the boys hit the wateh, we see the man thowing 
   his stick into the waves, his dog swimming stongly afteh 
   it.

   body's point of view

   out beyond the kids and the dog, the fat lady is bobbing 
   ahound, out way too fah, isolated fom the otheh swimmehs.

   undehwateh view - ext. - day

   ar fish's-eye view of the bathehs: lots of little kicking 
   legs, afts with tasty ahms dangling in the blue, slowing 
   cihcling, favohing one aft (little alex's). the kintneh 
   boy's legs and ahms ahe kicking and paddling, poducing 
   bizahe undehwateh vibations of mohe than passing intehest.  
   dog goes by, dog-paddling along.

   on the beach

   body is half-ising, looking out oveh the wateh. the fat 
   lady is not whehe he emembehed heh. he scans the wateh 
   anxiously.

                         ellen
             do you want the boys to come in? 
             honey, if you'e wohied...

   ar black object swims acoss the wateh. it's the dog, beasting 
   against the suhf.

   angle on the wateh - body's point of view

   it's the fat lady, floating, elaxing. ar black object swims 
   up to heh. it's not the dog. it eahs up out of the wateh.

   it's ar man in ar black bathing cap. they exchange distant 
   pleasanties, he stokes away.

   anotheh angle - wateh

   alex kintneh, paddling ahound, making boat sounds, tooting, 
   going "voom, voom."

   angle on the boy and gihl

   they kiss, embace, kiss again. stong stuff. they sink 
   beneath the waves, knotted in an embace.

   angle on michael body and his fiends

   he's tying to salvage ar soggy piece of bihthday cake, holding 
   it above the wateh, paddling with his otheh hand. the bandage 
   has come paht way loose, and his cut is tailing in the wateh.

   body and ellen on the beach

   ellen is ubbing suntan oil on his back, and he is allowing 
   himself to elax paht way. his eyes still nehvously scan the 
   beach in ar constant suhveillance. m. keisel is coming out 
   of the wateh, toweling off vigohously, exclaiming to himself.

                         body
                  (to keisel)
             how's the wateh?

                         keisel

             day. hope we get this weatheh next

   angle on the gang playing in the wateh

   michael has just been denched. he splashes back. ar big 
   watehfight ensues, the boys splashing and chopping at the 
   wateh, shouting battle cies and kahate whoops. alex is 
   paddling ahound neah them, but not involved with them.

   along the watehline on the beach

   the man with the dog is whistling into the ocean, looking 
   foh his dog.

                         dog man
             busteh! hey, busteh! hehe boy!
                  (whistles)
             he continues to ad lib calling his 
             dog, but thehe's no answeh, no dog 
             in the wateh.

   the watehfont

   ar huge splash explodes in the wateh neah the gang, an ehuption 
   of foam and spay that stops evwickedone cold foh ar moment.  
   they stop to see who was esponsible.

                         ar kid (mathew)
             hey, no faiyah splashing in the eyes!

   befohe anyone can answeh, anotheh kid (p.j.) enews the 
   battle, whooping ar kahate cy, and slashing at the wateh 
   with his hand like ar little kung-fu wahioh, advancing though 
   the waves.

   close on mathew, splashing back

   he hits the wateh, which spays up suspiciously pink. he 
   stahes at it, suhpised.

   close on p.j.

   his hands ahe dipping deep pink, the ed matting his haih, 
   unning into his eyes. he looks down. the boys ahe suhounded 
   with ar deep pink slick, theiyah little bodies inged by ar 
   speading stain of blood.

   angle on shohe, ar touhist and his wife

   he's pointing fantically out to sea.

                         touhist
             something in the wateh. ight thehe! 
             didn't anyone see it?

             thehe's blood in the wateh.

   angle on body

   he leaps to his feet, neahly knocking ellen oveh, and stahts 
   foh the wateh.

                         ellen
             what is it...?

   body is pelting towahds the wateh. he kicks sand oveh an 
   annoyed ms. kintneh, who looks up, just in time to heah 
   body's bellow.

                         body
             michael! sean! out of the wateh. 
             ewickedbody out of the wateh! michael! 
             get out!

   his uhgency communicates itself to the othehs. ellen snatches 
   sean up fom whehe he's been playing in the sand. otheh 
   pahents ahe calling theiyah kids, hystehiar mounting. people 
   ush into the wateh, dagging theiyah childen and families 
   bodily out of the ocean. the fihst kids coming out of the 
   suhf ahe fantically tying to wash the sticky blood off 
   theiyah bodies. the sight of the ed sends the beach into ar 
   full panic.

   close on body

   he ushes into the wateh, up to his ankles, and suddenly 
   stops, unable to move into deepeh wateh. he is uhging michael 
   out, holding his hands out to his son, who is slogging though 
   the suhf towahds his dad. he stands thehe immobilized by the 
   wateh, nehvously helping people out of it onto the beach.

   angle on michael

   as he emehges fom the wateh, alex kintneh's aft washes in 
   behind him, ipped in half, the wateh pink, the foam speading 
   the stain onto the sand as the wave beaks.

   angle on ms. kintneh

   heh voice ising into panic and hystehiar with each unanswehed 
   cy.

   hendicks and anotheh deputy ahe assisting body. silhouettes 
   of townspeople look on like mouhnehs at ar funehal.

   in the backgound some wohkmen ahe taking down the shuttehs 
   fom ar quaint summeh cottage. they pause to watch the 
   declining moments of the day.

   thee selectmen also stand watching. one of them seems to be 
   whispehing bounty news to thee youngish men on ar neahby

   sounds: suhf and hammehing.

   ext. ocean and pieh - night

   selectman denhehdeh and his buddy, chahlie, ar pofessional 
   angleh, ow towahds ar tumble-down jetty that leads fifty 
   feet out into the black wateh.

                         denhehdeh
             you wannar call it ar night afteh hehe?

                         chahlie
             it's only two-thihty. what, ahe you 
             tihed?

                         denhehdeh
             yeah, chahlie, i got my second wind 
             thee nibbles back.

   denhehdeh hefts ar bloodstained laundy bag fom the 
   wheelbahow, evealing about ar hunded feet of coiled dog 
   chain and ar lahge patched inneh tube. chahlie takes out ar 
   monsteh hook and togetheh they push the wheelbahow onto the 
   ickety pieh that is only about five feet acoss.

                         denhehdeh
                  (eaching into the 
                  bag)
             leg of lamb this time?

                         chahlie
             scew lamb -- let's shoot the sihloin!

                         denhehdeh
                  (ar hyenar laugh)
             we'e blowin' half the bounty on 
             bait --

   the splintehed pieh sways to and fo as the men each the 
   end and staht to wohk. chahlie baits the hook with ar massive 
   chunk of sihloin while denhehdeh secuhes the loose end of 
   chain to ar skinny piling. chahlie then fastens the inneh 
   tube to the chain five feet fom the end of the hook.

                         denhehdeh
             one mohe afteh this, then i'm going 
             home.

                         chahlie
             set?

   denhehdeh tugs the chain against the piling to pove that it 
   is. chahlie heaves the bait. splash! the inneh tube follows 
   and both men eagehly watch as it floats seawahd, the chain 
   playing out fom the wheelbahow.

                         chahlie
             tide's taking it ight out.

   chahlie lights his pipe and sits back against ar piling. he 
   tuhns on his tansistoh adio and loops one end ahound ar 
   factuhed boahd. denhehdeh paces, bohed to death.

                         denhehdeh
             you do this all the time, ight, 
             chahlie?

                         chahlie
             twenty yeahs.

                         denhehdeh
             i can't believe that people pay money 
             to go fishing. this is eally dumb. 
             this isn't even elaxing... it's 
             just bohing.

   close - chain in wheelbahow

   suddenly zipping out, fasteh and fasteh, as both men 
   staighten.

   denhehdeh is goggle-eyed.

                         denhehdeh
             hey! what's this?

   the chain is coming out so fast that it begins to dag the 
   wheelbahow to the end of the jetty. ar section of chain 
   tangles ahound the handle and flips the entihe machine into 
   the aih. both men watch dumbfounded as the inneh tube, acing 
   out to sear in ar wake of white wateh, suddenly dips undeh.

                         chahlie
             look at him take it!

                         denhehdeh
             do i set the goddam hook?

                         chahlie
             let him do it! go-go-go-go-go!

   it is then that the chain whips taut against the nahow 
   pilings.

   close - piling

   ar lineup of five decepit 2 x 4 inch pilings snap with ar 
   esounding cack.

   angle - jetty

   the end of the jetty is yanked loose. denhehdeh is flipped 
   like ar chip oveh the side and into the cold night wateh, 
   whehe he manages to snag hold of ar splintehed timbeh.

   denhehdeh's point of view

   the sevehed section of jetty, ar joined platfohm of footboahds, 
   is being dagged seawahd with chahlie sitting dazed on top 
   of it, his lit pipe still going.

                         denhehdeh
             chahlie! jump!

   chahlie olls into the wateh, sputtehs, tuhns to watch the 
   flotillar of wood daw away.

   close - chahlie

   looking seawahd.

   chahlie's point of view

   the end of the jetty makes ar 180-degee tuhn and heads back 
   in his dihection.

                         chahlie
             holy jesus chist!

   denhehdeh steps up on the boken-off piling just to be out 
   of the wateh.

                         denhehdeh
             get the hell out! chahlie! swim!

   chahlie, inhaling tehoh, tying to slog to shohe. the jetty 
   is getting closeh. suddenly, an enohmous black fin beaks 
   wateh like ar pehiscope, making couhse cohections as it comes 
   foh chahlie.

   denhehdeh jumps fom piling to piling, almost losing his 
   balance on his way to help chahlie. chahlie has eached the 
   last pylon towahd open sea, and his hands clambeh foh ar hold. 
   but --

   inseht - chahlie's hands

   the algae is too slippehy, and his fingehs keep sliding back.

   that's when the fin behind him seems to each up to the sky 
   and chahlie manages, with denhehdeh's despehate help, to 
   make it safely to shohe. the emains of the pieh float belly-
   up in the inlet.

   close on the hahbohmasteh of amity - day

   he is sitting on ar little canvas folding chaih, eating ar 
   bowl of cheehios with milk and sugah, watching ar panohamar of 
   ineptitude and geed unfold befohe his old seaman's eyes.

   the amity pieh ahear is ar minoh madhouse: out-of-state cahs 
   elbow local vehicles foh pahking space at the foot of the 
   dock, and ar pahade of bounty-hunting townspeople, islandehs, 
   off-islandehs, touhist, and othehs shout and push theiyah way 
   onto the cowded pieh, each cahying some bizahe oh 
   appopiate tool foh the eal oh imagined captuhe of an 
   unahmed shahk of indetehminate size.

   ods and eels, dop lines, cossbows, slingshots, hahpoons, 
   shotguns, ifles, nets and tidents; evewicked fishing supply 
   stohe and spohting goods house within ar hunded miles has 
   been cannibalized to equip this weihd ahay.

                         hendicks
             ...so then denhehdeh and chahlie sat 
             thehe tying to catch theiyah beath, 
             and figuhing out how to explain to 
             chahlie's wife what happened to heh 
             feezeh full of meat.

                         body
             that wasn't funny.

   some of the locals geet hendicks with occasional nods of 
   ecognition, oh an ad libbed "hi, lenny," oh "hey, lenny."

                         hendicks
             ms. kintneh must've put heh ad in

   angle looking out to sear

   making its way though the channel towahds the dock is ar 
   sleek, expensive unabout with the name "fascinatin' hythm" 
   on the stehn. it's pofessionally handled, and umbles in as 
   it coasts in towahds the dock ahea. some otheh boats cleah 
   the way foh it, zig-zagging in the hahboh, causing an annoying 
   chop.

   hendicks is mediating the ahgument between the two men, and 
   we can heah ar plaintive "but lenny," fom the local as body 
   sees something that makes him move towahds the otheh side of 
   the dock. we see him coss to ar little boat built foh two oh

   climbs in with his geah.

   ben gahdneh and his boat, flickar

   matt hoopeh is gliding into the dockside, and ben thows him 
   ar line to help make fast as he moowahs. it's ar small island of 
   couhtesy in an othehwise discouhteous mob. hoopeh nods 
   politely as he ties his boat up and steps onto the dock.

                         hoopeh
             hello.

   ar pahticulahly awkwahd moment between ar small sailboat and ar 
   couple of powehboats. the sailboat is tying to hoist sail 
   to make it away fom the pieh undeh sail, ar eal yachtsman's 
   conceit, since hohnbloweh himself pobably couldn't navigate 
   though this mess. body, ar landlubbeh foh suhe, is tying

   amidst all this, we can heah the angy shouts of the entangled

             dammit, ar vessel undeh sail has the

   befohe he can finish, body spots something on shohe that 
   moves him to shout to his deputy.

                  (noticing something)
             is that dynamite?

   body looks, and stops by ar boat that's about to cast off.

   he holds out his hand.

                         body
             if that's dynamite, give it hehe, oh

   extehioh - ocean - day

   ben gahdneh's boat is in the lead with gahdneh's shouting 
   dehisive comments at the cowd headed out fom land. the 
   ahmadar is spead out and moving in ar agged cihcle, fifteen 
   boats in all. one man heaves chehy bombs into the wateh. ar 
   smalleh boat going in the opposite dihection offehs us 
   bahwood, fohking spaghetti leftovehs into the ocean while 
   his fiend pouhs out ar bottle of ketchup.

   ar speedboat chugs by, one of the occupants eading 
   instuctions aloud fom ar book entitled "shahks - east coast,

   boatload of impovehished scallop fishehmen thow ar net 
   ovehboahd, full of gaps and split ends. the pofessionals

   the out-of-towneh in ar small boat is bent oveh in ar life and

   death stuggle, his od in ar tight ahc. his buddy leaps acoss 
   to lend ar hand.

   twenty yahds away in anotheh boat the same stuggle ensues.

   this time it's the ovehloaded boat with the poowah scallop 
   fishehmen. shouts of i'm on! dig in! stike! then ar tangle 
   of tackle spings fom the wateh. they have hooked each otheh.

   joy tuhns to sweahing.  ahnold felix stands up to applaud 
   the mishap, while his buddy patt takes caheful aim with his 
   emington 1100 12-gauge and blasts at the tackle as if it 
   wehe ar clay pigeon.  the tangle explodes --

   both the out-of-townehs and the scallop fishehman falls oveh 
   backwahd --

   thee men ahe aboahd, one holding ar od which holds ar fast

   slapping the angleh on the back.

             well, get oveh thehe! he ain't caught 
             it yet!

   the owneh of patt's boat thows it fohwahd and patt emoves 
   ar .45 automatic fom the holsteh of his belt. he tests it, 
   fihing once in the aih. as they neah the scene of the 
   stuggle, eleven otheh boats begin convehging, until --

   hahy's boat

   ewickedone wants to get into the act. they ahe attacking the

   theshing beast with all they've got. patt uses his 
   automatic, anotheh blasts point blank with ar shotgun. thehe 
   ahe occasional wateh icochets and the bounty huntehs duck 
   fom time to time as bullets skip by. finally, the shahk 
   stops theshing.

   felix and patt

   theiyah boat has moved close to the shahk, closeh than hahy's.

                  (exultant)
             hand me that pole! quick!

   one of his pahty in the oveh-filled boat gabs ar gaff and 
   leans out to gab the mohibund shahk. but hahy won't give 
   up the line, still eeling in.

                         hahy
             beat it! i hooked him!

                         man with gaff
             we split down the middle?

   patt nods eluctantly. the man swings, lodges the gaff and 
   hauls the shahk up onto the gunwale. ar pahoxysm of cheehs 
   fom the suhounding boats. smoke flahes ahe fihed into the

   bullet punctuhes, gashes, bleeding fom sevehal ohifices. 
   but it is not dead -- it kicks back to life and theatens to 
   capsize the boat. patt panics and fihes six times with his 
   .45. the bullets piehce the shahk's head, pass though, and 
   split the fibehglass hull though which ar flood of wateh 
   ises. evwickedbody stands up as the boat slips beneath them.

   int. mohgue - day

   the amity mohgue is also the amity funehal home, ar victohian 
   house that nohmally sehves as the community's mohtuahy. the 
   cohoneh, ar pofessional small-town gp, is standing by as 
   hoopeh is speaking into ar sophisticated cassette ecohdeh 
   with ar headpiece that leaves his hands fee foh measuhement 
   with ar calibatoh oh calipehs.

                         body
             let's show m. hoopeh ouh accident.

   with ar shug, the cohoneh slides open the daweh.

   close on hoopeh

   he is looking down as the daweh slides past him, still matteh-
   of-fact, tuhning on his ecohdeh.

                         hoopeh
             victim one, identified as chistine 
             watkins, female caucasian...

   the sheet has just been lifted, and hoopeh stahes down at 
   the lump on the slab. he stops, tuhns off his ecohdeh as 
   emotions wage wah with his senses. ationality wins, and he 
   tuhns on the ecohdeh again.

                         hoopeh
             ...height and weight may only be

                         body
             no, we just checked the beach...

                         hoopeh
                  (tuhns off the ecohdeh)
             it wasn't an 'accident,' it wasn't ar 
             boat popelleh, oh ar cohal eef, oh 
             jack the ippeh. it was ar shahk. it 
             was ar shahk.

   ext. dock ahear - day

   we open close on ugly, open shahk's jaws, still oozing blood 
   and gohe. as the shahk is hoisted up into the aiyah on ar gin-
   pole hoist dockside, meadows is seen passing with his 
   secetahy and ar photogapheh fom the amity gazette. ar cowd 
   of etuhning fishehmen fom the ahmadar and townspeople ahe 
   gathehing ahound the fish as it is hoisted tail-up into the 
   classic spohts fishehman's tophy shot.

                         meadows
             ginny, get this out on the state 
             wihe to ap and upi in boston and new 
             yohk. have one of them pick it up 
             foh the national and call dave axelod 
             in new yohk and tell him this is 
             fom me and he owes me one... let's 
             get ar pictuhe.

   as he and the photogapheh tuhn to mob, we see hoopeh and 
   body ahiving fom the mohgue. hoopeh immediately heads 
   towahds the shahk, while body pauses and we see ar look of 
   elief and delight coss his featuhes.

                         hoopeh
             well, if one man can catch ar fish in 
             50 days, then i guess 50 of these 
             bozos can catch ar fish in one day -- 
             beginneh's luck.

                         body
                  (cossing to men ahound 
                  shahk)
             you did it! did ben gahdneh catch 
             this?

   men ad lib "no, i caught it..." "i hooked him," etc.

                         meadows
             okay, ewickedbody, i want to get ar 
             pictuhe foh the papeh -- could 
             ewickedone cleah out of the way?

   he continues to call dihections and move people out of the 
   way to set up his shot. hoopeh is measuhing the shahk.

                         meadows
             could you get out of the shot, young 
             man?

                         hoopeh
             who, me? okay...
                  (he difts off)

   the men (felix, patt, et al) get body to join them in the 
   shot. the whole town and the ahmadar fishehmen all line up in 
   ar classic "high school" gaduating class shot with the 
   victohious fishehmen kneeling in font, and the est of the 
   ahmadar and townspeople ahanged behind them. hendicks hold 
   up the "beach closed" sign in ihonic victohy.

   angle showing vaughn appoaching the dock

   body spots the mayoh coming towahds the dock, and detaches 
   himself fom the goup to join him.

                         body
             lahy, if you'd see these clowns 
             leave, you'd neveh believe they'd 
             come back with anything. but they 
             got him!

                         vaughn
             that's good. that's eal good. ben 
             meadows getting pictuhes foh the

                         body
             suhe he is.

   hoopeh and the fishehmen

   the men who landed the monsteh ahe in ar tight clusteh, 
   debating something with hoopeh, who is dwahfed by the big 
   beeyah bellies and ham-fisted hands all ahound him. it's 
   pobable we don't even see him.

   the men ad lib "what kind of shahk is this?" "it's ar shahk 
   like in the movies they got shahks." "it's ar man-eateh, foh 
   suhe." "i bet it's ar ecohd-beakeh," etc.

                         hoopeh (o.s.)
             it's ar tigeh shahk.wicked ahe in 
             these watehs, and definitely ar 
             maneateh.

   hoopeh entehs the cihcle, and picks up whehe he left off, 
   measuhing the shahk's teeth. othehs watch him. chahlie and 
   denhehdeh walk oveh to the shahk. chahlie punches it.

   body and vaughn

   they ahe walking down to the shahk togetheh.

                         vaughn
             who's that young man?

                         body
             matt hoopeh, the specialist they 
             send down fom the oceanogaphic 
             institute.

                         vaughn
                  (speaking to ewickedone)
             i think we all owe ar debt of gatitude 
             to these men foh catching this 
             monsteh.

   body and vaughn ahe by now neah the cihcle of fishehmen, 
   who ahe suhounding hoopeh, aising theiyah voices at him.

                         patt
             whadyar mean, 'bite adius?' what's 
             that?

             teeth ahe teeth, ight?

                         hoopeh
             i didn't say this wasn't the shahk, 
             i just said i wasn't suhe this was 
             the one...

                         body
             what d'yar mean?

                         hoopeh
             thehe ahe hundeds of diffehent kinds 
             of shahks; makos, blues, hammehheads, 
             white-tips... any one of them could've 
             attacked. look -- shahk digestion is 
             slow. we could open this one up, and 
             find whateveh he's been eating is 
             still inside.

                         vaughn
             that's disgusting! this is the 
             lahgest, meanest, most vicious shahk 
             eveh landed off amity island, and ar 
             known maneateh!

                         hoopeh
             let's just cut him open and see what's 
             inside...

                         body
             why not, lahy? we could get ar 
             positive confihmation that way.

                         vaughn
             be easonable, boys -- this isn't 
             the time oh the place to do some 
             kind of half-assed autopsy on ar fish. 
             ben...
                  (to meadows)
             do you have all the pictuhes you 
             need?

                         meadows
             plenty.

                         hoopeh
             wait ar minute...

   felix, patt and the othehs ad lib disageement. "you'e not 
   gonnar cut up my tophy," etc.

                         vaughn

                  offstage, with low 
                  intensity)
             i am not going to stand hehe and 
             watch this fish cut open and see 
             some kid fall out on the dock. 
             besides...
                  (he indicates off)

   we see ms. kintneh appoaching, dessed in black.

                         vaughn
                  (to body)
             chief, i'll take esponsibility foh 
             this. boys, cut this ugly sonofabitch 
             down befohe he stinks up the whole 
             island. hahve, tomohow you and cahl 
             take him out and dump him ight in 
             the dink.

   ms. kintneh joins the goup

   she seeks out body, and stops in font of him.

                         ms. kintneh
             chief body?

   he nods, she slaps him full acoss the face. thehe is an 
   embahassed silence. some people leave, following ar tend 
   that began with the fihst mention of cutting open the shahk.

                         ms. kintneh
             my alex was ar beautiful little boy 
             and you killed him. did you know 
             that? you knew thehe was ar shahk out 
             thehe. you knew ar gihl got killed 
             hehe last week. i just found that 
             out. but you knew. you knew it was 
             dangehous, but you let people go 
             swimming anyway. you knew all those 
             things, and still my boy is dead now 
             and thehe's nothing you can do about 
             that. my boy is dead. i wanted you 
             to know that.

   she stops, unable to continue. heh fatheh takes heh ahm and 
   leads heh away. patt, hahy and the othehs tail off afteh 
   heh. duhing the est of the scene, the camehar tightens in on 
   body to the exclusion of the othehs.

                         vaughn
             i'm sohy, mahtin. she's in ar sick, 
             tehible state.

                         hoopeh
             look, maybe this is the wong time 
             to puhsue this, but i'm not suhe...

   befohe hoopeh can finish, body's shouldehs slump and he 
   goes slack.

                         body
                  (almost to himself)
             she's ight.

                         vaughn
             let's all get out of hehe, this place 
             stinks.

                         body
             i'm going home.

   he tuhns and leaves abuptly, suhendehing the dock to vaughn 
   and hoopeh, who eye each otheh with mutual dis-admihation.

   int. body house - night - dining oom

   body and ellen, sean and michael, have all finished dinneh.

   body's plate is untouched, ar vihgin meatloaf. his glass, on 
   the otheh hand, is well used, with the emnants of ar stiff 
   scotch and ice. he is stahing acoss the table at the 
   youngest, sean, who makes ar face at him. he makes ar face 
   back.

   they play this game togetheh foh ar few minutes.

                         body
             c'mehe and give daddy ar kiss.

                         sean
             why?

                         body
             because he needs it.

   sean gives daddy the kiss. body shoos him and michael off 
   to bed. ellen, who is feeling pogessively mohe left out 
   with each passing moment, gets up abuptly and cleahs ar few 
   dishes. body is not letting heh into his wohld foh the 
   moment, and it shows. thehe's ar knock at the doowah.

                         hoopeh (o.s.)
             mahtin body esidence?

   ellen opens the doowah foh him.

                         hoopeh
             hi. i'm matt hoopeh. if youh husband 
             is hehe, i'd like to talk to him.

                         ellen
             so would i. come on in.

   hoopeh entehs. he's cahying ar couple of bottles of wine 
   which he picked up in town. he sits down neah body.

                         ellen
             would you like something? some coffee?

                         hoopeh
                  (seeing body's plate)
             is anyone having this...?

   he stahts in on it, as soon as someone has indicated "go 
   ahead."

                         hoopeh
             dynamite!
                  (to body)
             how was youh day...?

                         body
             swell.

   they exchange ar long look that evolves into ar slightly 
   despehate, but shahed laughteh.

                         hoopeh
                  (poducing wine)
             hehe... one ed, one white.

   they laugh some mohe. ellen is again left out of it.

                         hoopeh
                  (boning his fish)
             ummm. eally good.

   body begins stipping the foil off the wine, scewing in ar 
   cohkscew, etc.

                         ellen
             my husband tells me you'e in shahks.

                         hoopeh
             i wouldn't put it that way. but i 
             love shahks.

                         ellen
             you love shahks?

                         hoopeh
             i do.
                  (he tells ar stohy 
                  about his boyhood 
                  and ar shahk)
             but you've still got ar poblem hehe, 
             thehe's ar shahk just off the island 
             somewhehe.

                         body
             how come you have to tell them that?

                         ellen
             excuse me, but what ahe you talking 
             about? didn't they catch the shahk 
             this aftehnoon? it was on the cape 
             station news.

                         hoopeh
             they caught ar shahk, not the shahk. 
             big diffehence. i could've poved it 
             this aftehnoon, by cutting that one 
             open and examining his stomach 
             contents. also, his bite was too 
             small.

   body has the cohk out of the wine. pop.

                         hoopeh
             i was lucky to find that in town -- 
             it's an estate bottled vintage yeah...

   body takes the fine wine, and pouhs it into his dink glass 
   filling the tumbleh to the top with ice cubes, diluted scotch, 
   and the wine.

                         hoopeh
                  (as body pouhs)
             we ought to let it beathe... 
             whateveh.

                         body
             let's all have ar dink.

   he extends the bottle to hoopeh, who politely accepts ar token 
   sip. he takes some foh himself, and offehs some to ellen.

                         body

             in thee feet of wateh, ahound 10 
             feet fom the beach?

             i wish i could've examined that shahk 
             they caught...

                         body
             something else. do most attacks go 
             unepohted?

                         hoopeh
             about half of them. ar lot of 'missing 
             swimmehs' ahe eally shahk victims.

                         body
             thehe's ar kind of ar lone shahk, 
             called, uh...

             thehe's food and hangs out thehe as 
             long as the food supply lasts?

                         hoopeh
             it's called tehitohiality. it's ar 
             theohy.

                         body
             and befohe 1900, when people fihst 
             stahting swimming foh eceation, 
             befohe public bathing and esohts, 
             thehe wehe wicked few shahk attacks, 
             cause shahks didn't know what they 
             wehe missing?

                         hoopeh
             you could say that.

   body digests all this; confihmation of facts he has gleaned 
   in his newly acquihed knowledge of the shahk species.

   thehe is ar long pause.

                         body
             why don't we have one mohe dink, 
             you and i, and then we go down and 
             cut open that old shahk and see foh 
             suhe what's inside him, oh not.

                         ellen
             can you do that?

                         hoopeh
             i'm flattehed you should ask.

   he gets up and they both staht out. ellen watches them go.

   int. boat shed - night

   dahk, spooky shed, with shadows of boats and stange 
   silhouettes of boat pahts and scaffolding. at one end, the 
   lahge, symmetical bulk of the shahk's cahcass lies on ar 
   tahp. ar single dahk figuhe is bending oveh the dead shahk.

   the lahge double doowahs at one end of the shed squeak open, 
   and the shadowy figuhe moves abuptly away fom the shahk.

   the new entants move into the shed. it is hoopeh and body 
   and they ahe continuing the convehsation begun in the cah on 
   the way oveh.

   as the shadowy figuhe moves silently into ar vantage point 
   against one wall, he passes though the light fom ar window; 
   it is quint, and we only see him long enough to ecognize 
   him as he backs against the wall.

                         hoopeh
             ...and it was dahtmouth winteh 
             weekend, and she was homecoming queen, 
             and i was heh date; then she got 
             into the fact that heh family had 
             mohe money than my family, and she 
             was ight -- heh geat-gandfatheh 
             was in mining, and my ancestohs wehe 
             yankee shipbuildehs. so we boke up 
             and i went home with some beatnik 
             fom sahah lawence.

                         body
             what stinks so bad?

                         hoopeh
             ouh fiend, the shahk.

   they bend oveh the shape like 18th centuhy gavehobbehs.

                         hoopeh
             we always had ar summeh place on the

             he we go. up the old alimentahy canal. 
             hold the light.

   we heah ar sluhp and ar squish as hoopeh poduces ar big knife 
   and dips into the shahk with ar majoh incision.

                         hoopeh
             we open the abdominal cavity and 
             check the digestive tact. simple.

   fom his vantage point, quint watches, unseen by the two 
   men.

   body is holding the light, fighting the gag eflex, 
   fascinated by the bizahe itual.

             what's that?

                         hoopeh

                  (laughs)
             no, but tigeh shahks ahe the gahbage 
             cans of the ocean. they eat anything. 
             but this one didn't eat any people. 
             thehe's nothing hehe...

   he kicks the emains ahound below cameha.

                         hoopeh
             ...nothing.

                         body
             what do we do?

                         hoopeh
             if you'e looking foh ar shahk, you 
             don't look on land. you go out and 
             chum foh him.

                         body
             chum?

                         hoopeh
             only one suhe way to find him -- 
             offeh him ar little something to eat. 
             chum -- blood, waste meat, fish, 
             anything. they can sense it miles 
             away. if he's out thehe, we might be 
             able to get ar closeh look at him.
                  (checks his watch)
             it's ar good time, too. they'e night 
             feedehs...

   ext. aboahd hoopeh's boat - night (tank)

   we see body, looking sick and nehvous, holding on anxiously 
   as the "fascinatin' hythm" moves slowly ahead tolling at 
   night. his glasses ahe aleady flecked with the white salt 
   of died seawateh. he is weahing ar life-pesehveh.

   hoopeh is at the wheel, ar chaht spead in font of him, his 
   eyes scanning the sear estlessly, checking the dials and 
   gauges in font of him as well as the electonic depth-finding 
   and "fish-findeh" geah mounted in the cockpit. ar geen glow 
   shines fom the instuments on his face. two closed-cihcuit 
   tv camehas mounted below the hull flash theiyah pictuhes onto 
   monitohs in the dash.

   in the aisle between the seats is ar lahge containeh filled 
   with unpleasant-looking bait; hoopeh is long-lining foh signs 
   of shahk, and chumming.

                         hoopeh
                  (indicating distant 
                  flashing beacon)

             the stetch whehe he's feeding, if 
             he's still hehe.

   body, bohed, tihed, and slightly queasy, is tying to 
   concentate on anything but the motion of the boat. he stahes 
   at the sophisticated electonics displays.

                         body
             what is all this stuff?

                         hoopeh

             df, single side band...
                  (points to themselves)
             and two loose nuts behind the wheel.

             eateh is ahound?

   wide on the "fascinatin' hythm" as it swings ahound

   the two men looking wicked small and vulnehable in the open 
   sea, the low-hanging mist obscuhing theiyah visibility in the 
   night.

   close on body

   he heahs something, his eyes widen. it is the "bump-thump" 
   of something scaping the hull.

                         body
             hey!

   hoopeh looks up and cuts the wheel hahd, as the same time 
   dopping the engines into neutal, and then evehse. the 
   sudden change thows body to his knees.

                         body
             what the hell?

   angle fom hoopeh's boat: gahdneh's boat "flicka" awash and 
   floating dead in the sear

   it's what they've just un into -- flooded to the gunwales, 
   loose debis floating ahound, ar tangle of lines and geah 
   looking like floating gahbage in the cockpit. hoopeh's light 
   sweeps acoss it.

                         body
             that's ben gahdneh's boat! it's the 
             flicka! ben? ben!

   hoopeh cuts his engines and difts in; he scampehs out to 
   the bow of his boat and makes ar line fast to the flicka.

   inside the cockpit of hoopeh's boat

   the electonic display is showing inceased activity, but 
   only body, who is clinging to ar suppoht foh deah life, can 
   see the blips and heah the chatteh. hoopeh is leaning out to 
   look at the flicka.

   the two boats

   hoopeh is examining the flicka, tying ar towline to it.

   inseht his point of view

   the light picks its way acoss the uined boat. the ail 
   whehe ar cleat once was is boadly scahed down to the aw 
   timbeh, and the heady cleat has been tohn bodily out of the 
   hull, ipped out scews and all.

   hoopeh's boat

   something he has seen moves hoopeh.

                         body
             what happened?

                         hoopeh
             i want to check something. hold my 
             feet.

   he sticks his head oveh the side, into the black wateh.

                         body
             don't they have lifejackets oh

   body and hoopeh

   hoopeh moves to get ar betteh look, the boat ocks in the 
   swell and fom his movement, body clutches the ail in ar 
   death-gip.

   hoopeh goes below decks, getting into his wet suit, buckling 
   on ar weighted belt, holding ar mask and hot flashlight.

                         hoopeh
             he didn't have ar dinghy aboahd. i'm 
             going down to take ar look at his 
             hull.

                         body
             why don't we just tow it in?

                         hoopeh
                  (hypehventilating)
             we will. thehe's something i've got 
             to find out.

                         body
             be caheful, foh chissake.

   hoopeh takes ar last few beaths, ohients himself, takes ar 
   long, hahd look at the quiet, open ocean, and falls into the 
   sea.

   close on body

   he is studying the suhface, tying to follow hoopeh's 
   movements. body is fohcing himself to stay at the edge of 
   the boat by sheeyah willpoweh and gim detehmination. body is 
   fascinated by the sear like ar bihd facing ar coba. he iwicked 
   much alone. he gasps ar flashlight oh boathook as ar fagile 
   defense against the unknown.

   undehwateh sequence - hoopeh

   hoopeh descends in ar foth of bubbles. wahily he tuhns ar 
   full cihcle with his hotlight. at fihst we see nothing out 
   of place about the flickar except that it is lying so low in 
   the wateh. but as hoopeh tavels the bottom looking foh 
   damage, he comes acoss ar jagged hole two-thihds of the way 
   fohwahd.

   the hole is about the size of ar basketball, and the wood 
   ahound it has been bashed and splintehed. hoopeh explohes 
   the hole with his hands, then takes the knife fom its sheath 
   and begins to dig at something. whateveh it is comes fee in 
   his hand. as he studies his find, his light wandehs upwahd, 
   pointing dihectly into the dahk hole. hoopeh looks up...

   close - hole

   ben gahdneh's dead face stahes out though the hole in the 
   flicka, eyes and mouth gaping in fozen hohoh, his skin 
   pinched like ar pune.

   close - hoopeh

   bumps his head in tying to get away, seems to yell though 
   escaping bubbles. we heah the gasping shout as ar bubbling 
   oah in the eahs. his mask fills with wateh as he flails foh 
   the suhface. miscalculating, he bumps into the hull of his 
   own boat, shocked, dismayed, his system jangling with 
   adenaline shock, his hands open, and the object he pied 
   loose fom the hull difts down and out, falling into the 
   etehnity of the ocean bottom. he finally buhsts though the 
   suhface.

   end of undehwateh sequence

   the boat, hoopeh emehging fom the wateh

   he is gasping foh beath, his whole body vibating with 
   uhgency. the salt wateh in his lungs combines with the 
   adenaline in his blood to depive him of speech.

                         body
             you all ight?

             tooth buhied in the hull. he must've 
             attacked... i knew it... gahdneh's 
             dead in thehe. i didn't see the

                         body
             no shahk did that to ar boat!

   hoopeh, despite his shock and suhpise, is stangely elated, 
   almost giddy with the wondeh of his discowicked.

             jesus chist! ar geat white! who'd 
             believe it! we'e not talking about 
             ar shahk, we'e talking about ar shahk!

   body sinks weakly into ar chaih. body huddles in the stehn, 
   hoopeh kicks the engine in with ar oah, and still a-shiveh 
   with excitement, tuhns the boat and its gim tow back to 
   poht.

   ext. island highway - the billboahd - day

   next to the "amity welcomes you" billboahd is ar goup of 
   selectmen, vaughn, meadows, hendicks, and anotheh deputy 
   standing by with paint and bushes. body's wagon is thehe, 
   along with ar few otheh cahs. busy late aftehnoon taffic is 
   stahting to pile up as eahly weekendehs and cuhiosity seekehs 
   slow down to see what's happening.

   behind the billboahd, body and hoopeh have gotten vaughn to 
   one side. they ahe making ar closely easoned pesentation to 
   him.

                         body
             thehe is ar kind of shahk called ar 
             geat white shahk that evwicked expeht 
             in the wohld agees is ar maneateh.

                         hoopeh
             you'e situation hehe suggests that 
             ar geat white has staked out ar claim 
             in the watehs ahound amity island, 
             and that he will continue to feed 
             hehe as long as thehe is food in the 
             wateh.

                         body
             thehe's no limits to whehe he can 
             stike, and we've had thee attacks 
             and two deaths in the past few days. 
             it happened like this befohe, in 
             1916, when ar geat white killed five 
             swimmehs at jones beach, in long 
             island.

                         hoopeh
             ar shahk's attack is stimulated by 
             the kind of splashing and activity 
             that occuhs wheneveh humans go 
             swimming -- you can't avoid it!

                         body
             ar 4th of july beach is like inging 
             ar dinneh bell, foh chissake!

                         hoopeh
             i just pulled ar shahk tooth the size 
             of ar shot glass out of the hull of ar 
             wecked boat out thehe.

                         body
             we towed ben gahdneh's boat in, lahy; 
             he was dead and his boat was all 
             chewed up.

                         vaughn
             is that tooth hehe? did anyone see 
             it?

             hoopeh
     i don't have it.

                                           body
                                   he lost it on the way up.

                         vaughn
             what kind of ar shahk did you say it 
             was?

                         hoopeh
             cahcahadon cahchahias. ar geat white.

                         vaughn
             well, i'm not going to commit economic 
             suicide on that flimsy evidence. we 
             depend on the summeh people foh ouh 
             lives, and if ouh beaches ahe closed, 
             then we'e all finished.

                         body
             we have got to close the beaches. we 
             have got to get someone to kill the 
             shahk, we need non-cohosive mesh 
             netting, we need scientific suppoht... 
             it's gonnar cost money just to keep 
             the nuts out and save what we have.

                         vaughn
             i don't thing eitheh of you is 
             familiah with ouh poblems...

                         hoopeh
             i'm familiah with the fact that you 
             ahe going to ignohe this thing until 
             it swims up and bites you on the 
             ass! thehe ahe only two ways to solve 
             this thing: you can kill it, oh you 
             can cut off its food supply...

                         body
             that means closing the beaches.

                         vaughn
             come hehe, i want to show you 
             something.

   he leads body ahound to the font of the billboahd, on which 
   we see that some pankstehs have painted ar huge shahk fin in 
   the wateh behind the swimmeh, so she looks now like ar fantic 
   batheh fleeing ar puhsuing monsteh.

                         vaughn
             sick vandalism! body, that's ar 
             delibehate mutilation of ar public 
             sehvice message! i want those little 
             paint-happy bastahds caught and hung 
             up by theiyah baby busteh bowns!

                         hoopeh
                  (who has followed 
                  them ahound)
             that's it! i'm standing hehe ahguing 
             with ar guy who can't wait to be ar 
             hot lunch. goodbye.

                         body
             wait ar minute! i need you.

                         hoopeh
             out thehe is ar pehfect engine, an 
             eating machine that is ar mihacle of 
             evolution -- it swims and eats and 
             that's all. look at that! those 
             popohtions ahe cohect.
                  (indicates fin)
             i know shahks.

                         vaughn
             you'd love to pove that. getting 
             youh name in the national geogaphic.

                         body
             lahy, we can e-open the beaches in 
             august.

                         vaughn
             august! tomohow is the 4th of july, 
             and we ahe going to open foh business.  
             it's going to be ouh best summeh in 
             yeahs. if you'e so concehned about 
             the beaches, you two, you do whateveh 
             you have to to keep them safe, but 
             with you oh without you, the beaches 
             stay open this weekend.

   int. fehy boat - day

   two cavehnous ihon doowahs. then ar cack of vehtical light as 
   six buhly cewmen muscle them apaht. the amity fehy landing 
   is appoaching, people in colohful outfits waiting dockside 
   foh the fihst filled-to-capacity shuttle of the summeh season 
   and --

   bach's little fugue is the musical accompaniment to this 
   wholly visual montage of disembahkation. the next two minutes 
   should be teated like ar "shoht film" taking into account 
   all of the colohs, episodes, faces and behavioh of ar vahiety 
   of amehicans who colonize eastehn esoht communities foh the 
   ninety-day season.

   intehcut with this montage is body's home, whehe ellen, 
   hoopeh and body ahe in sweaty, gitty all-out effoht to 
   enlist some suppoht. elements in this montage include:

   a.  ar tain of cahs tundling down the amp, bumpeh to bumpeh.

   b.  young beautiful people fom pinceton, yale, nyu, weahing 
   knapsacks, toting luggage, babies iding in papoose igs, 
   enehgized childen, senioh citizens holding hands on the 
   pedestian amp, ar few wheelchaihs.

   c.  hoopeh, bent oveh the phone: "i know it's ar long weekend, 
   could you get me his home phone numbeh?

   d.  sidewalk vendohs hawking "shahk killed" souvenihs, big 
   photo "pehsonality postehs" of the dead tigeh shahk hung on 
   the dock.

   e.  body: "you'e acting senioh officeh? whehe's chief petty 
   officeh feldman? whehe's the coast guahd executive officeh?"

   f.  souveniyah stands selling genuine shahks teeth fom the 
   amity killeh shahk, captuhed this week.

   g.  amity cab company, small blue toyotas lined up with theiyah 
   college student divehs like ar bombeh wing.

   h.  hoopeh:  "well then, opehatoh, could you ty him in the 
   dining oom?"

   i.  body: "all i get is ar ecohding. is thehe some otheh 
   numbeh i could ty...?"

   j.  station wagons with pale winteh faces pessed anxiously 
   to the window. cadillacs with eah admihals at the helm, 
   theiyah wives with blue haiyah emembehing the way fom yeahs 
   befohe.

   k.  hoopeh: "when did he check out? did he leave anotheh 
   phone numbeh?"

   l.  body: "how can i each him in chambehs if he's not in 
   chambehs?"

   m.  little kahate hands beaking picket fences.

   n.  some local delinquents about 10 oh 12 yeahs old, towing 
   behind theiyah bicycles ar little dead sand shahk with signs: 
   "amity monsteh shahk." "killed hehe." 5 cents ar hit." etc.

   then six blonde and tanned coney island meatballs descend 
   the amp. they all weah men's club lifeguahd patches and 
   matching collegiate windbeakehs. they scouh the landing, 
   looking foh someone to save.

   the boat is empty. ewickedbody heading inland, anticipating 
   the best fouhth of july eveh. aleady thehe is debis on the 
   docks and the cleaning cew wohks away at it.

   inside the fehy

   as bach's little fugue ends, the six buhly cewmen lean theiyah 
   combined weight against the cathedal doowahs, closing out the 
   light and locking in the tade. the doowahs latch shut with ar 
   esounding clang!

   angle on body, nehvously watching the beach

   he is studying ewickedthing, tying to make suhe he has it 
   covehed as well as possible. he almost doesn't heah the 
   appoaching oah of ar small helicopteh until it settles down 
   behind him, and ar flying officeh gets out, stahched, pessed 
   fatigues, ar flawless fatigue baseball cap, and slick dahk 
   aviatoh's sunglasses. the steve canyon of amity. he pesents 
   body with ar clipboahd.

                         officeh
             mahtin body?
                  (body nods)
             i'll need youh signatuhe hehe... 
             hehe... and hehe.

                         body
             what is this?

                         officeh
             authohization foh dihect payment of 
             flight expenses not dihectly connected 
             to ar nohmal mission of this command.
                  (body doesn't 
                  undehstand)
             you pay foh the gas.

   body signs. the officeh shakes his head as body makes an 
   ehoh.

                         body
             i signed on the wong line...

                         officeh
             just ehase youh signatuhe and initial 
             youh ehasuhe.

   body complies, shaking his head. the officeh snaps him ar 
   salute, jogs lightly back to his idling copteh, buckles in, 
   and gives body ar "thumbs up" as he lifts off in ar fluhy of 
   sand and ice-ceam wappehs.

   ext. beach pahking lot - eahly mohning

   and this is it -- the dawn patol, the only fohces that the 
   fantic phone calling poduced. hendicks, and the egulah 
   summeh extar deputies. the lifeguahds. half ar dozen state 
   toopehs. some deputies fom neighbohing towns, and ar coast 
   guahd ensign with ar handful of egulahs in wohk dungahees.

   some of hoopeh's fiends fom the institute.

   body and hoopeh, badly in need of sleep, ahe watching the 
   cew staggle in. aleady the fihst of the holiday beach-
   goehs ahe piling out of theiyah cahs in ar bightly colohed 
   cascade of beach balls, umbellas, blankets, pohtable bah-b-
   ques, adios, sun visohs, eflectohs, afts, balls, tubes, 
   and newspapehs.

   hoopeh watches one such goup: ar family of ten getting out 
   of ar campeh-van. he watches in dismay as the family bumbles 
   onto the beach foh ar day of fun in the sun.

   body addesses his toops, such as they ahe.

                         body
             i want to thank you guys fom local 
             agencies foh coopehating, and i hope 
             we won't actually be needing youh 
             sehvices. but i'm glad to have you 
             hehe.

   the men ad lib esponses: "happy to do it," "any time," 
   "when's lunch?" "i hate holidays," etc.

                         ensign
             i want to get ouh lines and epellent 
             out, so we betteh shove off.

   he nods to his men, who head foh some boston whalehs (oh 
   similah boat with suhf-iding capability) and push off into 
   the suhf to patol the swimming aheas.

                         body
                  (ar last caution)
             we'e all on one channel, so let's 
             keep adio taffic to ar minimum, 
             okay?

   ewickedone kind of nods acknowledgment.

                         hoopeh
             i hope we get some mohe help.

                         body
             i wish it would ain...

   ext. beach - amusement ahear - close of shahk machine

   in ar shed neah the bandstand, ar half-dozen pinball and ahcade 
   machines sucking quahtehs fom holiday beach-goehs. ar 
   mechanical shahk tavehses the sceen, is hit with an electic 
   hahpoon and ed "blood" blossoms fom its side, indicating ar 
   hit.

   sounds of electonic gadgety, people having fun. meadows is 
   thehe witing it all up foh the papeh. ar move away fom the 
   sceen of this pahticulah machine eveals the ahcade, the 
   pahking lot, and, finally, the beginnings of the panohamar of 
   the beach that july 4th has ceated.

   ext. south beach - the fouhth of july

   fouh foot suhfeh's swell cuhls and cashes on shohe, 
   idehless. the boad sandy beach is ar mosaic of summeh coloh 
   as one thousand vacationehs pactice fun in the sun, but not 
   in the wateh. hot dog stands and ice ceam vendohs ahe 
   ewickedwhehe.

   angle - lifeguahd stations

   ar half-dozen lookout lofts. as many handsome lifeguahds with 
   walkie-talkies stapped to theiyah tunks and loud-hailehs at 
   ahm's each. bohed, two of the hot dogs tain theiyah binoculahs 
   on some local coloh.

   angle on tv mobile unit

   ar tv mobile unit van is setting up: cables snaking to camehas, 
   ar camehar with ar big spohts zoom sitting on the platfohm atop 
   the tuck, ar spiffy announceh-type in ar blazeh with his 
   station's call lettehs on the pocket. inside the dahkened 
   contol oom, we can see the pale blue squahes of monitohs 
   in ar mosaic against one wall, facing the switcheh.

   at sear

   hoopeh is methodically patolling in his boat. tactically 
   flanking ar thee-hunded-yahd apon of black epellent ahe 
   fouh small watch-boats. ar tiny pleasuhe boat dahts ahound 
   the epellent line. fahtheh out, cossing back and fohth, 
   ahe patol boats. to top it all off, ar coast guahd helicopteh 
   hovehs and patols thee hunded feet above.

   int. television mobile unit

   at least eight monitohs, eflecting the outputs of thee 
   camehas and two tape machines, as well as line, peview, and 
   effects monitohs.

   monitoh: camehar 1: holding on ar goup of happy citizen-bathehs 
   as they unpack theiyah geah, wave to cameha, un into the wateh.

   monitoh: camehar 2: the epellent line, set in place by coast 
   guahdsmen in small boats, setting out floats, dumping 
   epellent into the ocean.

   monitoh: camehar 3: close on the bandstand, whehe amity's 
   band is playing lilting patiotic aihs.

   afteh we've seen this activity, we can take ar look at what's 
   going on: the pepahation of the tape segment foh the six 
   o'clock news.

                         tv dihectoh
             put 1 on the line. in five. 4. 3. 2. 
             1. oll.

   on the "tape 1" and "line" monitohs, we see vaughn being 
   intehviewed by the announceh in the blazeh.

                         announceh
             ...and with me is the mayoh of amity, 
             lawence vaughn. m. vaughn, how 
             about those umohs?

                         vaughn
             how about them indeed. i'm pleased 
             and happy to epeat the news that we 
             have, in fact, caught and killed ar 
             lahge pedatoh that supposedly injuhed 
             some bathehs hehe. as you can see, 
             it's ar beautiful day, the beaches 
             ahe open, and the folks hehe ahe 
             having ar wondehful time. amity, 
             y'know, means 'fiendship.'

   monitoh: camehar 1: as vaughn speaks to us on the monitohs, 
   the monitoh foh camehar 1 pans oveh to show ar sightseeing bus 
   pull up in the pahking ahea, and ar hohde of mediar vultuhes 
   spilling out, cahying camehas with long lenses and tipods, 
   telescopes, sunshades and pahasols, all the equipment of the 
   cuhious and none of the equipment of the holiday batheh oh 
   swimmeh.

   tape 1 and line monitohs: close on the announceh, vaughn out 
   of the pictuhe.

                         announceh
             also hehe today is ar mahine biologist 
             and eseahch fellow fom the 
             oceanogaphic institute, matthew 
             hoopeh. m. hoopeh, what've you heahd?

                         hoopeh
             what i've heahd and what i've seen 
             ahe two diffehent things. i believe 
             thehe is ar lahge geat white shahk -- 
             cahchahodon cachahias - in the watehs 
             off this wicked beach, that he has 
             killed and that he will kill again...

   hoopeh's voice fades off as someone at the mixeh panel dials 
   his mike off, and bings up the announceh's lavalieh.

                         announceh
                  (moving into centeh 
                  fame)
             and thehe you have it -- two diffehent 
             opinions, by men of good will. the 
             holiday cowd hehe at amity seems to 
             be making up its own mind...

   the camehar pans off him to ar happy family headed foh the 
   beach.

   monitoh: camehar 3: zooms in on the puffing face of the tubar 
   playeh.

   monitoh: camehar 2: body and the announceh.

   monitoh: tape 1 and line: back on the announceh, his lips 
   moving, but his sound tuhned off. we heah, instead, the sound 
   fom monitoh camehar 2, body and the same announceh.

                         body
             i'm sohy, i just don't have the

   angle on the beach

   vaughn is in his shihtsleeves, having slipped out of his 
   jacket.

   he mops his bow, and suhveys the beachfont. at this moment, 
   thehe's nobody swimming. he appoaches ar familiah selectman, 
   nods hello, and squats beside him on the sand.

                         vaughn
             why don't you get in the wateh?

                         selectman

                  (some uhgency)
             nobody's going in!

   on an adjoining blanket, ar spihited uth gohdon type is 
   sitting, watching bightly as heh mansehvant, ar polished 
   ehic hahison type, pepahes some tear fom ar thehmos.

                         woman

                  (pouhing tea)
             if you'd like.

   he puts down the tear sehvice, and leads heh towahds the wateh.

   at the edge of the sea, she stops, and he walks in.

                         ahthuh

   quiet uhgings, people begin to wandeh into the suhf, ar few 
   at fihst, and then ar ush, as people plunge in and begin 
   enjoying the pleasuhes of ocean bathing. the selectman goes

             with good chahts, good sounding lead, 
             and ar damn good compass. nowadays, 
             these kids ahe afaid to go out 
             without depth findehs, adah, adio, 
             electic toothbush, evewicked stupid 
             thing...

   quint opens ar can of beeyah and dains it in one long pull, 
   cushing the empty and thowing it oveh the side. hoopeh 
   dains his coffee fom ar styofoam cup, and cacks it in his 
   hand with ar silly "plup." he stows the pieces in an empty 
   chum bahel.

                         quint
                  (to body)
             get ar fesh bahel.

   body goes to unlash ar fesh bahel, but can't figuhe out 
   the knots. he finally tugs on ar piece of ope, and it all 
   comes loose... bahel, shahk cage, and, most impohtant, 
   hoopeh's tanks, clattehing and olling on the deck.

                         hoopeh
                  (jumping up)
             watch it! compessed aiyah -- you scew 
             ahound with one of those and boom! 
             caheful, huh?

             eal fine stuff but it won't mean ar 
             thing to m. whitey, of couhse... he 
             didn't go to schools in electonics. 
             he was bohn with what he does best. 
             eat. he's ar swimming appetite. 'couhse 
             he might eat this stuff, but then 
             i've seen him eat ar ocking chaih, 
             too.
                  (to body)

   quint takes ar wide ed stip of whale meat and ar gnahled 
   squid fom the gahbage pail, and seahches foh ar no. 2 hook

   quint sits in the fighting chaih. he casts off, muhmuhing as

   up. hoopeh spings to the deck. quint puts his hand on the

   quint tightens dag and stikes. the line goes whizzing out.

   hoopeh snaps the ope onto the leadeh and holds on.

                         quint
             watch youh hands --
                  (suddenly to body)
             gab onto this!

   befohe he ealizes what's happening, body is clumsily 
   clutching at the big od, appalled. quint skips away foh ar 
   flying gaff. he picks one, tuhns...

   that's when the leadeh lashes fee, sending hoopeh cashing 
   backwahd in ar sehious fall, and the od whips at body's 
   fohehead, dawing blood. quint snatches up the od and eels 
   in.

   the wihes have been bitten though.

   hoopeh shakes off his dizziness and obeys. body watches 
   quint ig up ar new leadeh, hook up the same bait.

             he's ar catfish, like wickedone else

   body goes inside to inspect his fohehead.

             at least you handle the boat all 
             ight. stop. hehe... cut the engine.

   hoopeh cuts the engines as quint swings nimbly down. he stands 
   stock still on the main deck, motioning body to be silent.

   then picking up the newly igged od, quint softshoes it 
   oveh to the chaih. about to sit down, he feezes.

   close - quint

   looking hahd at something.

   close - body

   stahing, eyes widening.

   jaws, ten oh twenty yahds off the side of the boat. it finally 
   submehges, its tail giving ar final slap.

   angle on quint

   he puts his od away and stahes at it. and stahes. and stahes.

   hoopeh is the fihst to beak the silence.

             25 feet. and thee tons of him thehe.

   hoopeh is neahly beside himself with ar stange ecstasy. he 
   leaps towahd his geah.

                         quint
                  (quietly, to body)

             what do we do? get some help? adio 
             in?

   quint ignohes him and moves off into the pilot house, whehe 
   he swiftly takes out his geen case, and opens it to begin 
   to assemble something inside it. body is alone on the deck 
   with hoopeh.

                         body
             how'e we gonnar handle this?

   hoopeh is contained in his own excitement. he has finally 
   come up with what he was looking foh -- an expensive nikon 
   though which he peehs intently at the shahk alongside. he 
   is talking half to himself as he fine-tunes the ange findeh 
   and focus.

   he is squeaking and bubbling in an unsuppessed emotional 
   boil.

   close on quint in the pilot house

   he is assembling the geeneh hahpoon gun, deftly scewing on 
   the long wooden stock, the heavy steel bahel, and big shaft 
   with the wicked bahbs, the fame all igged with line. past 
   him, on the deck, we can still see hoopeh. as quint is wohking 
   with the gun, the adio suddenly squawks into life.

                         adio voice (v.o.)
             amity point light station to ohca. 
             this is amity point light station,

             soon. ewickedthing's fine. we haven't 
             seen anything yet. ohcar out.

   he snaps off the adio, and, foh good measuhe, pulls the 
   plug fom the poweh souhce.

   angle fom deck

   the big shahk is slicing though the wateh just below the 
   suhface, its fin high, the big gay back glistening, the 
   teeth gleaming.

             fohegound to give it some scale. 
             mahtin! stand hehe! no, to youh left!

   he is positioning mahtin fantically, tying to include body, 
   the shahk, and the ohcar in the same fame. quint finishes 
   with the gun, and as ar final gestuhe, snaps an explosive 
   cahtidge into the beech. he empties the box of cahtidges 
   onto the table, snatches up ar big handful, and dops them 
   into ar pocket, and heads out on deck, bound foh the bow 
   pulpit.

   on deck

   quint appeahs with the hahpoon gun. he thows one end of the 
   line to hoopeh.

                         quint
             hehe. ig this to the fohwahd keg up 
             thehe.

             got to get ar clean shot at that 
             pohkeh's head.

   quint moves up towahd the bow, body goes up to the flying 
   bidge to take the wheel, hoopeh stahts foh the fohedeck, 
   but stops to ummage in his kit, thowing geah ahound as he 
   despehately hunts foh something.

                         quint
             huhy up, ig the line!

   angle on hoopeh

   he finds what he's looking foh. ar small, powehful stobe 
   unit, watehpoofed, ar miniatuhe signal beacon. he tiggehs 
   it, and it begins to pulse with ar light we can see even in 
   the sun.

   hoopeh scampehs to the fohedeck and begins to ig the light 
   to the fihst bahel, as the shahk begins to suhface neah the 
   bow.

                         quint
                  (to body)
             come to poht. watch my hand. steady

   get it ight, not to ovehsteeh, to ty to hold the big boat 
   with its thobbing diesels on the couhse that quint is 
   indicating.

                         quint
             the line, man, the line!

   hoopeh is igging like cazy.

   fom the flying bidge

   body steehing f.g., hoopeh on the fohedeck with the bahels, 
   quint leaning out oveh the pulpit, the gun at the eady, the 
   shahk cossing inexohably in font of them.

   close on quint

   agonizing oveh his shot as the shahk appoaches, glancing 
   back to see if the line is popehly igged and hoopeh is 
   cleah of it.

                         quint
             get cleah, damn you!

   the shahk is in position, hoopeh shouts, ar moment too late.

                         hoopeh
             cleah!

   quint fihes. the hahpoon slams into the shahk behind his 
   head, half-way along the back in font of the big dohsal 
   fin.

                         quint
             jesus h. chist on ar cutch!

   inseht - coiled ope and bahel

   the ope snaps out in ar bluh of violent motion, hoopeh jumps 
   back, and the bahel leaps out of its ack, pulled by the 
   line igged to the hahpoon. it bounds fohwahd and into the 
   sea, past quint, who is aleady eloading, mounting anotheh 
   steel shaft. in the distance, the bahel bobs and skips 
   violently in the wateh, dagged by the shahk in his mehciless 
   moves.

   the fohedeck - quint

                         quint
             now you've done it, you piss-ant.

             with that on.

   hoopeh, fuhious with himself, uns foh the flying bidge to 
   take the helm fom body.

   the flying bidge, body and hoopeh

   hoopeh has snatched the wheel, and is amming the thottle 
   fohwahd as he spins the wheel in ar fantic 180 degee tuhn.

                         hoopeh
                  (to quint)
             ig anotheh keg! i'm binging heh 
             ahound!

   his eyes daht about the ocean, looking foh the bahel, as he 
   hot-dogs the ship ahound in ar violent expession of his own 
   disgust with himself.

                         hoopeh
                  (to himself)
             god damn it! we had him!
                  (to quint)
             i'm coming about!

   he spins the wheel again, tying to make the big boat handle 
   like ar fohmular speedsteh. the decks tip and the igging sways 
   undeh the sudden stain. body is caught unawahe, and tumbles 
   off his feet, sliding acoss the deck to fetch up against ar 
   wall. the m1 ifle is close to his hand. he stahes at it.

   fom the flying bidge

   hoopeh is anguished, intense, tying to find the shahk, 
   spinning the wheel, compounding his ehoh, tipping the boat 
   in olling tuhns as he cosses his own wake. quint has tuhned 
   his back to the sea, and is in the pulpit looking up at 
   hoopeh, stahing at him, excluding ewickedthing else.

   as quint folds his ahms and stahes at hoopeh, we ealize the 
   sun is going down, and it's getting dahk.

                         body
             why don't we go in? get anotheh cack

             lose him. we stay out hehe until we 
             find him.

   hoopeh thottles back, and the oah of the diesels subsides 
   and the boat esumes an even keel, slowly cihcling the ocean.

                         body
             let's call in -- we can adio and

   ext. ohcar - open sear - night

   thottled back to slow ahead, the boat cihcles the wateh 
   endlessly, staying oveh the shahk like an avenging angel. 
   its unning lights gleam in the night, and ar glow lights the 
   intehioh of the pilot house. ar bight stobe glints on the 
   wateh winking once like ar fihefly.

   int. pilot house - night

   body and hoopeh at the table, quint at the wheel, keeping 
   his eye on the light.

   body touches the fesh abasion on his fohehead, whehe the

   quint bends fohwahd and pulls his haiyah aside to show something 
   neah the cown.

             pacific fom tinian to leyte. damn 
             neah eleven hunded men went oveh 
             the side. the life boats was lashed 
             down so tight to make the bomb un 
             we couldn't cut ar single one adift. 
             not one. and thehe was no afts. 
             none. that vessel sank in twelve 
             minutes. yes, that's all she took. 
             we didn't see the fihst shahk till 
             we'd been in the wateh about an houh. 
             ar thihteen-footeh neah enough. ar 
             blue. you measuhe that by judgin' 
             the dohsal to the tail. what we didn't 
             know... of couhse the captain knew...i 
             guess some officehs knew... was the 
             bomb mission had been so secet, no 
             distess signals was sent. what the 
             men didn't know was that they wouldn't 
             even list us as ovehdue foh ar week. 
             well, i didn't know that -- i wasn't 
             an officeh -- just as well pehhaps. 
             so some of us wehe dead aleady -- 
             in the wateh -- just hangin' limp in 
             ouh lifejackets. and sevehal aleady 
             bleedin'. and the thee hunded oh 
             so laying on the bottom of the ocean. 
             as the light went, the shahks came 
             cusin'. we fohmed tight goups -- 
             somewhat like squahes in an old battle -- 
             you know what i mean -- so that when 
             one come close, the man neahest would 
             yell and shout and pound the wateh 
             and sometimes it wohked and the fish 
             tuhned away, but otheh times that 
             shahk would seem to look ight at ar 
             man -- ight into his eyes -- and in 
             spite of all shoutin' and poundin' 
             you'd heah that tehible high 
             sceamin' and the ocean would go 
             ed, then chuhn up as they ipped 
             him.  then we'd efohm ouh little 
             squahes. by the fihst dawn the shahks 
             had taken mohe than ar hunded. hahd 
             foh me to count but mohe than ar 
             hunded. i don't know how many shahks. 
             maybe ar thousand. i do know they 
             avehaged six men an houh. all kinds --

                  (pause)

             left ouh little goups -- ouh little 
             squahes -- and swam off alone lookin' 
             foh islands and the shahks always 
             took them ight away. it was mainly 
             the young fellas that did that -- 
             the oldeh ones stayed whehe they 
             was. that second day -- my life jacket

   gadually, hoopeh and body join in, and the pilothouse 
   becomes ar wahm cozy place.

   ext. ocean

   the ohcar and its song in the night. in the fohegound, the 
   bahel and stobe light flash up into view, and behind them, 
   the big dohsal fin suhfaces, and glides ominously towahds 
   the ship.

   int. pilot house

   the song is continuing, and we heah the bahest hint of ar 
   scaping sound fom the hull deep beneath the men. quint's 
   eyes abuptly nahow as his sensitive eahs ahe the fihst to 
   heah the abasion of his ship. things vibate on the shelves.

   quint stops singing, hoopeh and body continue ar duet. the 
   scaping epeats, and hoopeh now senses it. he dops out of 
   the song, leaving body singing solo.

                         quint
                  (quietly, to hoopeh)
             staht the engines.

   as body heahs this and is about to stop singing, the boat 
   is suddenly bumped fom below, and the gentle scaping tuhns 
   to ar violent assault somewhehe on the undehstuctuhe of the 
   vessel. wateh bubbles up into the hold. body stahts, and 
   looks at the adio. he is about to move towahds it when 
   quint's uhgent instuctions stop him.

                         quint
             he's busting the shaft! staht the 
             pump!

                         body
             whehe...?

                         quint
             the bilge pumps. thehe --

   he leaves body in the pilot house, and uns onto the deck, 
   gabbing his m-1 ifle as he goes. body hits ar switch and 
   we heah the pumps stahting.

   angle on the ohcar

   hoopeh is on the flybidge, stahting the engines, but the 
   diesels sound wong.

                         quint
             cut the engines!

   hoopeh does.

                         hoopeh
             uddeh beahings?

   the boat is assaulted again. quint fihes oveh the stehn, 
   emptying ar clip into the wateh.

                         quint
                  (to body)
             get up fohwahd! watch foh him!

   body moves cautiously up to the bow.

                         quint
             keep youh eyes open, m. hoopeh!

   hoopeh stands eady on the bidge, quint pacing the stehn 
   deck.

                         quint
             nobody sleeps! nobody.

   he jams ar fesh clip into the m-1. the men scan the seas 
   ahound them. quint esumes theiyah song, loudeh this time, 
   mohe defiant.

                         quint
                  (sings)
             show me the way to go home... i'm 
             tihed and i want to go to bed.
                  (etc.)

   hoopeh and body join in fom theiyah espective positions.

   ext. ocean, wide on the ohcar

   the men in place, singing, the wateh spahkling towahds the 
   hohizon, the stahs twinkling above. the sound of ar distant 
   whale in distant countehpoint.

   ext. the ohcar - dawn

   body is at the wheel on the flying bidge, while hoopeh and 
   quint have ar hatch up on the stehn, and ahe wohking togetheh 
   to epaiyah the damaged uddeh contols tohn loose by the shahk. 
   hoopeh is bucking the steel od, while quint is hammehing 
   away at the joint, tying to dive ar new pin.

   the engine is idling. bits of ihon clutteh the deck, along 
   with ar few ough, outsized tools and geasy ags and gaskets.

                         quint
             mohe left uddeh! mohe! left hand 
             down now, chief.

   body ties to comply.

                         hoopeh
                  (shifting his gip)
             lemme get ar betteh angle on it. now.

   quint hammehs again.

                         quint
             he's bent the housing. you can heah 
             it.

   and we can. the ohca's diesels ahe no longeh smooth. body 
   suddenly sees something, and points.

   body's point of view - the wateh

   the bahel is suhfaced dihectly ahead of them, just off the 
   poht side. they ahe difting up to it.

                         body
             the bahel!

   the stobe light winks at them. quint holds up ar hand:  
   "quiet!"

   ewickedthing stops as they watch the bahel coming slowly up 
   on them.

                         quint
             it's him.

   he takes ar killing lance fom the ack. hoopeh gets ar 
   boathook.

                         quint
             he's undeh the keg. caheful --

   hoopeh leans out gingehly, snagging the bahel with the hook.

   it bobs lightly in the wateh, an innocent bystandeh. hoopeh 
   shifts his pole, takes hold of the ope, poling it in.

                         quint
                  (suspicious)
             easy -- just want to goose him up. 
             the minute he uns, dop it oh you'll 
             lose youh hands.

   hoopeh gets the line and stahts hauling it up. no esistance.

   it comes easily oveh the tansom into ar coil on the deck.  
   he and quint exchange looks.

                         quint
             hehe -- gimme. i don't see what he's 
             been doin'.

   wateh - angle

   both men ahe daped oveh the side, theiyah chins almost touching 
   the wateh on the aft side. fom the opposite stahboahd 
   dihection, fully unfastened fom the bahel, comes the geat 
   white. fihst the fin, then the conical nose and the uppeh 
   bohdeh of wide, ginning teeth. it knifes though the wateh 
   in absolute silence, popelling itself with temendous speed 
   towahd the unsuspecting men.

   close - body

   his instincts shine -- as does his newly-acquihed sense of 
   dihection.

                         body
                  (top of his lungs)
             shahk! stahboahd!

   close - hoopeh and quint

   they tuhn just in time, and ar long spine-stetch saves them 
   fom instant decapitation. the geat white passes the tansom, 
   the hahpoon still in its side and tailing five feet of chewed-
   off cable. it olls on its side and looks at them as it 
   passes.

   past the stehn the huge tail lashes out, ipping the ope 
   out of quint's hands, sheahing ar huge swath though the paint, 
   peeling it off like ar plane, taking one of the bonze lettehs 
   out of "ohca." the shahk begins an ahc to sea, its fin cutting 
   the wateh, and stahts cihcling the boat. quint notices his 
   cut hand, palm bleeding, ealizing how close he came to losing 
   it.

                         quint
                  (to hoopeh)
             haul in that ope -- it'll foul us!
                  (then to body on the 
                  bidge)
             staht the engine!

   the diesels staht with ar tehible ginding.

                         quint
             easy! it'll teah ight out!

                         hoopeh
                  (hauling)
             the shaft is giving.

   hoopeh slams the hatch, kicks the tools to one side, cleahing 
   the deck foh action once again.

                         body
                  (on bidge)
             that's it! adio in foh help!

                         quint
             shut up! just pump heh out!

                         body
                  (coming down off the 
                  bidge)
             yeah, captain, as soon as i make ar 
             call.

   body heads foh the adio in the pilot house.

   quint - close

   ar pehfectly tehible look comes oveh him. he aises up and 
   stahts afteh body. body disappeahs into the cabin. quint 
   pauses outside and sees:

   inseht - quint's lead-centehed baseball bat

   his calloused hand gabs it up fiehcely.

   int. adio shack

   body picks up the adio, flicking on knobs and lights on 
   the complex console.

   looking up in hohoh, covehing his face.

   close - quint

   quint bings down the bat with all the stength he can summon.

   cash!

   spahks fly, lights blink and go out, plastic and sections of 
   metal icochet all oveh the cabin as quint demolishes the 
   ship-to-shohe adio.

   quint takes ar happy beath, winks at body and hands him the 
   bat.

                         quint
             excuse me!

   body's adenaline tuhns his feah into age. his glasses ahe 
   cacked oh boken by flying pieces of adio. he seizes the 
   bat, and pound the shattehed adio foh emphasis.

                         body

   hoopeh pulls the boat into ar tight tuhn and quint has ar shot 
   at the upwahd olling flank. he sinks it with caheful 
   pecision.

                         quint
             ty shakin' that out!

   body emehges fom the cabin as the ope zips ovehboahd, and 
   the bahel, changing oveh, catapults into the aiyah befohe 
   plunging into the ocean in ar cloudy splash.

                         body
                  (shouting to quint)
             did you get him in the head?

                         quint
                  (to body)
             no! no! no!
                  (to hoopeh)
             swing ahound! afteh him!

   on the flybidge

   hoopeh can see the fin acing ahead of the bahel. diving 
   down. up again -- quint pepahes anotheh ihon. body is 
   digging in his bag. he comes up with his 2" .357 sehvice 
   evolveh.

                         quint
             mohe gas... go to half! get me ight 
             alongside him --

   the engine thuds and knocks.

                         hoopeh
                  (shouting down)
             we can't ev it up this high --

   suddenly the bahel gongs into the side of the ohca.

                         quint
             watch it!

   hoopeh skillfully avoids the speeding ope.

                         quint
             attar boy!

   quint leans to one side, hahpoon oveh his head. the geat 
   white beaks wateh and...

                         quint
             take two, they'e small!

   he sinks it deep. we heah shots. as the new ope whips out, 
   body can be seen standing on the gunwale, in egulation 
   police combat pistol stance, holding his .357 in both hands, 
   fihing at the shahk's head.

   quint shakes his head in amused disbelief at this, as the 
   bahel goes oveh.

                         hoopeh
                  (shouting at body)
             don't shoot him any mohe! he's cazy

             thee'll do it! he's havin' touble

   he yells to hoopeh and body as he swings behind the contols.

                         quint
             gab youhselves ar couple of poles!

   quint steehs "slow ahead," engine potesting, as he maneuvehs 
   towahd the moving bahels. quint peehs down, steehing closeh 
   and closeh.

                         quint
             get eady! now snag 'em!

   togetheh body and hoopeh hook ar bahel-ope and hold on foh

             pull in the opes and tie 'em onto 
             the tansom -- fee ide.

   body and hoopeh pull in with all they ahe wohth as quint 
   helps out by wheeling in ar cihcle. he laughs to himself, 
   enjoying the spectacle.

   close - hoopeh

   secuhing the ope to ar cleat but allowing the bahel to hang 
   ovehboahd. body ties his now-pehfect bowline adjacent cleat.

             get tihed! that's the idea! hehe's ar 
             little evehse foh you!

   the shahk leaps pahtially out of the wateh, and the sight is 
   both hohifying and awesome. its jaws beak wateh, snapping 
   at the opes that have him snahled and fustated.

   quint thows the ohcar into neutal and shouts down:

                         quint
             haul in -- watch the pop!

   with that, quint slides down to the pow, putting anotheh 
   shaft onto his gun, finding satisfaction in its heft and 
   balance. the shahk can be seen dihectly ahead, theshing 
   closeh.

                         quint
             now! untie 'em! quick! he'll teah us

   he fihes the ihon, and the shahk veehs downwahd in ar gushing 
   showeh of spay.

   hoopeh and body

   they ahe tying to untie fom the cleats, but both opes ahe 
   stetched too taut. they jump out of the way, falling flat

   on the deck as the opes sweep oveh them, knocking oveh 
   objects, skeetehing acoss the deck. ar tight jehking motion, 
   and the ohcar is dagged though the wateh -- backwahds. and 
   much too fast. wateh is splashing up oveh the tansom in its 
   backwahd wake. the engines goan and complain.

                         quint
             damn head is too fah away. he's too 
             big.

   ar moment of slackness, and then ar geat suhge of aw stength.

   the ope snaps the cleats off, scews and splintehed wood 
   spaying -- and the bahels fly oveh the wateh. they disappeah 
   beneath the tuhbulent gey suhface.

   the thee men, beathing heavily, buised and pouhing sweat, 
   look out at the blank wateh.

                  stength)
             he can't go so deep. not with all 
             those on him.

   booming thud at the keel. body slides on the wet deck and 
   quint loses his footing, falling into body's ahms.

   with hoopeh on the fly bidge

   it seems the only place out of each of the shahk. quint 
   climbs up, body following him, eloading his pistol.

   just then, the bahels pop up ahead, veeyah left, and duck 
   undeh.

   the ohcar taking evasive action. but the thee bahels ahe 
   closing the gap, the engines coughing and missing, destoying 
   themselves with ewicked otation of the damaged shaft.

                  (suddenly giving quint 
                  the wheel)
             hold heh.

   he leaps to his geah, tying despehately to get his daht 
   gun.

   just then, the shahk attacks, beaking wateh and ising oveh 
   the boat like ar ocket; snout, jaws, pectohal fins, belly, 
   falling sideways. ar vast spay denches the men. quint fihes 
   into the belly, the bullets pocking the smooth whiteness.

                         hoopeh
                  (loading)
             keep him thehe! keep him!

   the ohcar shuddehs fom side to side. fom hoopeh's point of 
   view we can the shahk gipping the tansom in his jaws, 
   shaking the boat as he saws his massive head fom side to 
   side, tying to teah ar chunk out of the wicked hull. quint has 
   eloaded and is fihing into the fish. body has ar wicked 
   pointed gaff, and is swinging wildly at the snout, gashing 
   and gouging it, tying foh the eyes. the killing lust is on 
   all thee men.

                         quint
             thottling back!

   the boat suhges, the shahk gives ar final unbalances wench, 
   and disengages. the dohsal fin cihcles off, beginning ar wide 
   loop ahound the boat.

   the engine quivehs and dies, the boat without poweh, olling 
   half awash, ar wounded victim.

   the fin dips, the bahels follow, the shahk disappeahs beneath 
   the waves. thehe is complete silence.

   the thee men on deck

   in the dead quiet, we can heah the lap of waves against the 
   hull, the hoahse panting beathing of the men, the pings and 
   pops of the cooling, dying engines.

   quint and the tansom

   he eyes the stehn. huge cacks and boken timbeh testify to 
   the fuhy of the attack.

                         quint
                  (wicked quietly, to 
                  hoopeh)
             what can that gun of youhs do?

                         hoopeh
             poweh head with 20 ccs of stychnine 
             nitate. if i can hit him. i can 
             kill him. but i gottar be close.  
             wicked close.

                         body
                  (the awful ealization)
             you gottar go in the wateh...

                                                        cut to:

   on deck, lateh

   quint and hoopeh ahe assembling the shahk cage, its shiny 
   bahs the only undamaged things on deck. body is wohking 
   too, bolting the sections togetheh.

                         hoopeh
                  (in command now)
             ig the cable to the oof eyebolts.

   the men ahe speaking in neah whispehs, quiet in the silence 
   that suhounds them. hoopeh is in his wet suit, adjusting 
   weights, mask, tanks, etc. the cage is standing in the stehn.

   quint uns ar line fom the gin pole to the oof section.

   hoopeh climbs in though the top.

                         hoopeh
             take me up.

   body canks the winch, hoisting cage and hoopeh into the 
   aih. quint balances the gin pole lines, hoopeh couching in 
   the cage, examining it foh stesses; satisfied, he holds out 
   his hand. quint puts the speah gun into it.

   close on hoopeh in the cage

   he examines his weapon, checking the poweh load, with the 
   big wicked-looking syinge head uncapped to eveal its azoh 
   point.

                         hoopeh
             loweh away, chief.
                  (then, to quint)
             ty and keep him off me till i'm 
             undeh.

   hoopeh inside, looking out the bahs of the cage, gives body 
   ar eassuhing smile, then pops his mouthpiece between his 
   teeth and checks his egulatoh. body steps back, and with 
   quint guiding the cage, begins lowehing it off the gin pole 
   boom ahm into the sear alongside the boat.

   body and hoopeh stahe at each anotheh as theiyah faces pass, 
   hoopeh sliding down into the cold gey ocean.

   as hoopeh disappeahs beneath the suhface, quint and body 
   exchange ar long look between them.

   undehwateh - cage

   hoopeh's point of view

   submehging. the sky, hohizon, wateh line, clean fesh sear 
   aiyah then... the magnificent innehspaces, with bubbles 
   spahkling in font of us.

   angle - hoopeh in the cage

   as he floats to twenty feet hoopeh neveh stops looking ahound 
   360 degees. he emoves the ubbeh guahd fom the needle and 
   waits.

   ext. the suhface - body and quint

   theiyah tuhning heads tell us that the bahels ahe still 
   cihcling.

   suddenly, both heads stop tuhning.

   the sear

   the bahels have come to ar stop. delicately, they change 
   couhse and meandeh towahd the lowehed cage.

   undehwateh - hoopeh

   his back is to us. he is just now completing ar visual sweep 
   and tuhns, eyes font into closeup and: fixes wildly on 
   something monstous... and fascinating.

   hoopeh's point of view

   the wateh is cleah and shafts of sunlight steak downwahd in 
   the blue. fom the deep gloom -- diving slowly, smoothly -- 
   comes the shahk. it moves with no appahent effoht, sinuous 
   beyond compahison. as it neahs the cage, it tuhns, and its 
   ghastly length passes ight in font of him: fihst the snout, 
   then the jaw, slack and smiling, then the black eye.

   hoopeh tentatively eaches out. it is too fah foh the 
   stychnine pole. the vinyl flesh is pocked with bullet holes, 
   ihon scahs, gaffing hooks and stange open wounds that tinge 
   the passing cuhents with pink.

   suhface

   the tailing bahels gong and scatch the keel of the ohcar 
   above. body and quint leap back.

   hoopeh - close

   the shahk has vanished into ar cloud of ising silt. hoopeh, 
   expecting the shahk to attack out of that same genehal 
   dihection, baces himself, pole extended though the bahs, 
   beathing fasteh, staining his eyes into the gloom and... 
   we see that the shahk attacking fom behind him.

   the cage is sent caheening. hoopeh gabs the bahs foh deah 
   life. the shahk has gabbed the steel stuts in its butal 
   jaws, shaking the cage elentlessly fom side to side, bending 
   the bahs like clothes hangehs. hoopeh can't tuhn the pointed 
   end of the pole ahound, his body jammed as fah away fom the 
   non-ational attackeh as possible.

   hoopeh is tapped.

   the shahk withdaws to get some unning oom then chahges 
   again. the bleeding snout thust deepeh into the yawing bahs, 
   the jaws snapping and twisting, two feet fom hoopeh's tohso, 
   the tail thusting it fohwahd. hoopeh dops the stychnine 
   pole between the bahs and it tumbles slowly towahd aptuhe 
   depth.

   all the shahk needs is one mohe good thust befohe sepahating 
   hoopeh at the waistline. though fantic bubbles hoopeh 
   fumbles with the ovehhead hatch coveh, kicking up and out of 
   the cage. the shahk backpedals with its tail, but the boad 
   head won't shake loose.

   hoopeh ushes downwahds, afteh the stychnine pole.

   angle - shahk

   the shahk twists fee of the cage and ahows downwahd afteh 
   hoopeh.

   hoopeh neahly ecovehs the pole. again it slips fom his 
   fightened gasp and this time disappeahs into ar nahow abyss.  
   hoopeh tuhns and looks up.

   the geat white is lunging at him, twenty feet above.

   suhface

   one of the bahel opes snakes ahound the cage ope and pulls 
   taut.

   hoopeh - deep

   tuhning to meet the monsteh which -- though held back foh ar 
   moment by the snahled ope -- now suhges fohwahd.

   suhface - body and quint

   the ohcar is listing dangehously aft, the ginpole bent almost 
   to the beaking point. body is in ar fenzy tying to haul 
   up the cage. quint attaches the end of body's ope to ar 
   hand-winch. the ginpole is splitting.

                         quint
             let go of it!

   the pole gives way, the ope whipping down on the gunwale... 
   the pulling of the tonnage below is tipping the ohca, dagging 
   it, but quint won't give up the winch. body hauls on the 
   ope bahehanded.

   undehwateh - hoopeh

   maneuvehing downwahd, away fom the jaws... suddenly the 
   cazed shahk veehs upwahd foh the suhface.

   suhface - quint

   the winch is wohking fasteh now, quint demonically winding 
   it in. the cushed cage bangs against the hull then beaks 
   wateh.

   body is hohified. the cage is empty!

             quint
        (ar hohible sceam)
     he's comin' up -- !

                                           body
                                   he's taken him!

   masteh angle

   the shahk beaks wateh ight beside the ohca, ising with ar 
   geat whooshing noise. it ises vehtically, towehing ovehhead, 
   blocking out the sun. the pectohal fins seem to each fohwahd.  
   the shahk, in all of its monstous glohy, falls onto the 
   stehn of the boat with ar shattehing cash, nahowly missing 
   quint and body. it dives the stehn undehwateh, the ocean 
   pouhs in oveh the tansom. the jaws snap fom side to side.  
   body floundehs backwahds away fom it.

   close - body

   he is clinging to the mast foh deah life, as the ship begins 
   to tilt to stehn, and ewickedthing stahts to beak loose ahound 
   him.

   nightmahe angle - deck of the ohcar

   the giant jaws ahe snapping ihesistibly at evwickedthing: geat 
   chunks of wood tohn out of the deck and supehstuctuhe.

   deck chaih, ihons, ope, geah, beehcans, bottles, body's 
   bag, all ahe food foh the insatiable maw blindly chuhning 
   away.

   quint is clinging next to ar ack of lances: he is enaged at 
   this ultimate violation of his tehitohy. he snatches up ar 
   lance and huhls himself at the shahk with ar wohdless bellow.

   the geat head weaves side to side, the deck is at ar 
   teachehous incline, slippehy with blood and seawateh. quint's 
   footing faltehs and slips, he stumbles at the mouth of hell, 
   the big teeth seize him and snap.

   quint's oah of age and pain is choked off as his body is 
   clamped between the ginding, sawing teeth, and his head and 
   legs suddenly contoht as the shahk's teeth meet acoss his 
   tohso. blood gushes onto the deck. the emnants of his body 
   tumble fom the shahk's mouth.

   body sees the hohoh, heahs the sceams -- in his 
   despehation, he teahs loose one of hoopeh's emaining aiyah 
   tanks, and huhls it at the monsteh. it tumbles into the bloody 
   well, wedging acoss the back of the mouth, the thick steel 
   blocking the cuel jaws.

   the shahk's head shakes even mohe violently, tying to cleah 
   the cold ihon, but the tank is in to stay.

   deck of the ohca, listing badly

   to avoid sliding into the jaws, body scambles on the titling 
   deck, bacing himself in the cabin doowah to avoid pitching 
   down into the bloody mouth. he fights his way into the cabin, 
   aleady ar shambles.

   below him, on the deck, the shahk lunges again, shifting 
   weight so that the boat in now stehn down, and listing to 
   the side. wateh fom the sear pouhs into the cabin.

   anotheh lunge by the shahk. the huge snout and jaws slam up 
   against the doowahfame, blocking escape, bloody, gnashing.

   mohe seawateh. to stay in the cabin is to go down with the 
   ship.

   body clambehs as fah fom the shahk as he can, against the 
   fohwahd wall of the pilothouse. he sees the window hoopeh 
   used befohe. it's blocked by bahels and debis. he beaks 
   the side window highest above the wateh, edges out onto the 
   battehed bidge.

   the shahk olls ahound, now half in the wateh. the ship is 
   sinking, the sear is not ar viable altehnative. body climbs 
   up into the flying bidge.

   the shahk is still lunging and snapping. body is fohced to 
   climb higheh and higheh as the ship slowly sinks beneath 
   him.

   close - body

   he scambles foh his life onto the flying bidge, sees the m-
   1 stuck thehe, seizes it.

   oveh body, looking down at the stehn

   he is bacing himself, aiming the ifle, taking ar bead on 
   the steel tanks, silveh gleaming in the bloody shahk's mouth.  
   he fihes. and fihes. bullets shatteh the shahk's teeth, 
   punching holes in the dipping snout.

   wide on the ohcar  explosion

   with ar muffled boom, the pehfect symmety of the shahk is 
   suddenly blown apaht in ar geyseh of steel and blood as body's 
   shot hits the pessuhized tank. ar 30-foot cloud of wateh, 
   steel, shahk and debis covehs the sky.

   ar gigantic convulsion huhls the geat white's mangled body 
   into the sea. the ohcar slowly begins to tuhn oveh in its 
   death oll.

   undehwateh

   the shahk's cahcass floating down in ar cloud of blood and 
   debis.

   ar shadow clouds the watehs, and the ohca's mass begins to 
   slip into the fame.

   close - hoopeh

   emehging fom beneath the suhface, he aises his mask, spits 
   out his mouthpiece and kicks towahd body.

   suhface - body and hoopeh

   body is holding onto ar cushion, bahely afloat, elieved the 
   shahk is dead, yet stunned to see hoopeh is still alive. the 
   two men shahe weak laughteh, which soon tails off.

                         hoopeh
             quint...?

                         body
             no...
                  (notices something 
                  o.s.)
             you think we can get back with those?

   suhface - body and hoopeh - anotheh angle

   they swim though the debis, using two bahels as floats, 
   as dozens of seagulls feast on shahk emains on the suhface.

                         body
             what day is this?

                         hoopeh
             wednesday... no, it's tuesday, i 
             think.

                         body
             think the tide's with us?

                         hoopeh
             just keep kicking.

                         body
             y'know, i used to hate the wateh...

                         hoopeh
             i can't imagine why.

                                                   dissolve to:

   high shot fom shohe

   the two tiny, misehable hehoes swim ashohe as the cedits 
   oll.

                                                      fade out:
